<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><i>PREFACE.</i></h2>


<p>The five Sermons which form the body of
this little book on Dante were delivered in
the ordinary course of my ministry at Little
Portland Street Chapel, in the autumn of 1878,
and subsequently at the Free Christian Church,
Croydon, in a slightly altered form.</p>

<p>They are now printed, at the request of many
of my hearers, almost exactly as delivered at
Croydon.</p>

<p>The substance of a sixth Sermon has been
thrown into an Appendix.</p>

<p>In allowing the publication of this little
volume, my only thought is to let it take its
chance with other fugitive productions of the
Pulpit that appeal to the Press as a means of
widening the possible area rather than extending
the period over which the preacher's voice may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
extend; and my only justification is the hope
that it may here and there reach hands to which
no more adequate treatment of the subject was
likely to find its way.</p>

<p>The translations I have given are sometimes
paraphrastic, and virtually contain glosses or interpretations
which make it necessary to warn
the reader against regarding them as in every
case Dante's <i>ipsissima verba</i>. For the most part
the renderings are substantially my own; but
I have freely availed myself of numerous translations,
without special acknowledgment, whenever
they supplied me with suitable phrases.</p>

<p>I have only to add the acknowledgment of
my obligations to Fraticelli's edition of Dante's
works (whose numbering of the minor poems
and the letters I have adopted for reference),
to the same writer's 'Life of Dante,' and to
Mr. Symonds' 'Introduction to the Study of
Dante.'</p>

</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<p>There are probably few competent judges who
would hesitate to give Dante a place of honour
in the triad of the world's greatest poets; and
amongst these three Dante occupies a position
wholly his own, peerless and unapproached in
history.</p>

<p>For Homer and Shakespeare reflect the ages
in which they lived, in all their fullness and
variety of life and motive, largely sinking their
own individuality in the intensity and breadth
of their sympathies. They are great teachers
doubtless, and fail not to lash what they regard
as the growing vices or follies of the day, and
to impress upon their hearers the solemn lessons
of those inevitable facts of life which they
epitomise and vivify. But their teaching is
chiefly incidental or indirect, it is largely unconscious,
and is often almost as difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
unravel from their works as it is from the life
and nature they so faithfully reflect.</p>

<p>With Dante it is far otherwise. Aglow with
a prophet's passionate conviction, an apostle's
undying zeal, he is guided by a philosopher's
breadth and clearness of principle, a poet's unfailing
sense of beauty and command of emotions,
to a social reformer's definite and practical
aims and a mystic's peace of religious communion.
And though his works abound in dramatic
touches of startling power and variety, and delineations
of character unsurpassed in delicacy,
yet with all the depth and scope of his sympathies
he never for a moment loses himself or
forgets his purpose.</p>

<p>As a philosopher and statesman, he had
analysed with keen precision the social institutions,
the political forces, and the historical
antecedents by which he found his time and
country dominated; as a moralist, a theologian,
and a man, he had grasped with a firmness that
nothing could relax the essential conditions of
human blessedness here and hereafter, and with
an intensity and fixity of definite self-conscious
purpose almost without parallel he threw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
passionate energy of his nature into the task of
preaching the eternal truth to his countrymen,
and through them to the world, and thwarting
and crushing the powers and institutions which
he regarded as hostile to the well-being of mankind.
He strove to teach his brothers that their
true bliss lay in the exercise of virtue here, and
the blessed vision of God hereafter. And as a
step towards this, and an essential part of its
realisation, he strove to make Italy one in
heart and tongue, to raise her out of the sea
of petty jealousies and intrigues in which she
was plunged; in a word, to erect her into
a free, united country, with a noble mother
tongue. These two purposes were one; and,
supported and supplemented by a never-dying
zeal for truth, a never-failing sense of beauty,
they inspired the life and works of Dante
Alighieri.</p>

<p>It is often held and taught, that a strong and
definite didactic purpose must inevitably be
fatal to the highest forms of art, must clip the
wings of poetic imagination, distort the symmetry
of poetic sympathy, and substitute hard and
angular contrasts for the melting grace of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
curved lines of beauty which pass one into the
other. Had Dante never lived, I know not
where we should turn for the decisive refutation
of this thought; but in Dante it is the very combination
said to be impossible that inspires and
enthrals us. A perfect artist, guided in the
exercise of his art by an unflagging intensity of
moral purpose; a prophet, submitting his inspirations
to the keenest philosophical analysis,
pouring them into the most finished artistic
moulds, yet bringing them into ever fresher and
fuller contact with their living source; a moralist
and philosopher whose thoughts are fed
by a prophet's directness of vision and a poet's
tender grace of love, a poet's might and subtlety
of imagination&mdash;Philosopher, Prophet, Poet,
supreme as each, unique as a combination of
them all&mdash;such was Dante Alighieri! And his
voice will never be drowned or forgotten as
long as man is dragged downward by passion
and struggles upward towards God, as long as
he that sows to the flesh shall of the flesh reap
corruption, and he that sows to the spirit reaps
of the spirit life everlasting, as long as the heart
of man can glow responsive to a holy indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with wrong, or can feel the sweetness of
the harmonies of peace.</p>

<p>It is little that I can hope to do, and yet I
would fain do something, towards opening to
one here and there some glimpse into that
mighty temple, instinct with the very presence
of the Eternal, raised by the master hand, nay
rather wrought out of the mighty heart of Dante;
but before we can even attempt to gather up a
few fragments of the 'Divine Comedy,' as landmarks
to guide us, in our turn, through Hell
and Purgatory up to Heaven, it is needful
for us to have some conception who Dante
Alighieri was, and what were his fortunes in this
mortal life.</p>

<p>And here I must once for all utter a warning,
and thereby discharge myself of a special duty.
The Old Testament itself has not been more
ruthlessly allegorised than have Dante's works
and even his very life. The lack of trustworthy
materials, in any great abundance, for an account
of the poet's outward lot, the difficulty of
fixing with certainty when he is himself relating
actual events and when his apparent narratives
are merely allegorical, the obscurity, incompleteness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and even apparent inconsistency of
some of the data he supplies, the uncertainty as
to the exact time at which his different works
were composed and the precise relation in which
they stand to each other, and the doubts which
have been thrown upon the authenticity of some
of the minor documents upon which the poet's
biographers generally rely, have all combined
to involve almost every step of his life in deep
obscurity. Here, then, is a field upon which
laborious research, ingenious conjecture, and
wild speculation can find unending employment,
and consequently every branch of the study has
quite a literature of its own.</p>

<p>Now into this mass of controversial and
speculative writings on Dante, I do not make
the smallest pretensions to have penetrated a
single step. I am far from wishing to disparage
such studies, or to put forward in my own defence
that stale and foolish plea, the refuge of
pretentious ignorance in every region of inquiry,
that a mind coming fresh to the study has the
advantage over those that are already well
versed in it; but surely the students who are
making the elucidation of Dante their life work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
would not ask or wish, that until their endless
task is completed all those whose souls have
been touched by the direct utterance of the
great poet should hold their peace until qualified
to speak by half a life of study.</p>

<p>With no further apology, then, for seeming
to venture too rashly on the task, we may go
on to a brief sketch of Dante's life and principles.
The main lines which I shall follow are in most
cases traced distinctly enough by Dante's own
hand, and to the best of my belief they represent
a fair average of the present or recent conclusions
of scholars; but, on the other hand,
there have always been some who would unhesitatingly
treat as allegory much of what I shall
present to you as fact, who for instance would
treat all Dante's love for Beatrice, and indeed
Beatrice's very existence, as purely allegorical;
and, again, where the allegory is admitted on
all hands, there is a ceaseless shifting and endless
variety in the special interpretations adopted
and rejected by the experts.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dante, or properly Durante, Alighieri was
born in Florence of an ancient and noble family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
in the year 1265. We may note that his life
falls in a period which we used to be taught to
regard as an age of intellectual stagnation and
social barbarism, in which Christianity had degenerated
into a jumbled chaos of puerile and
immoral superstitions! We may note also that
in the early years of his life the poet was a contemporary
of some of the noblest representatives
of the feudo-Catholic civilisation, that is to say of
mediæval philosophy, theology, and chivalry,
while his manhood was joined in loving friendship
with the first supremely great mediæval artist,
and before he died one of the great precursors
and heralds of the revival of learning was growing
up to manhood and another had already left
his cradle. To speak of Roger Bacon, Thomas
Aquinas, and St. Louis, as living when Dante
was born, of Giotto as his companion and
friend, of Petrarch and Boccaccio as already
living when he died, is to indicate more clearly
than could be done by any more elaborate statement,
the position he occupies at the very
turning point of the Middle Ages when the
forces of modern life had begun to rise, but the
supremacy of mediæval faith and discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
was as yet unbroken. Accordingly Dante, in
whom the truest spirit of his age is, as it were,
'made flesh,' may be variously regarded as the
great morning star of modern enlightenment,
freedom, and culture, or as the very type of
mediæval discipline, faith, and chivalry. To
me, I confess, this latter aspect of Dante's life
is altogether predominant. To me he is the
very incarnation of Catholicism, not in its shame,
but in its glory. Yet the future is always contained
in the present when rightly understood,
and just because Dante was the perfect representative
of his own age, he became the herald
and the prophecy of the ages to come, not,
as we often vainly imagine them, rebelling
against and escaping from the overshadowing
solemnity of the ages past, but growing
out of them as their natural and necessary
result.</p>

<p>In the year 1265, then, Dante was born in
Florence, then one of the most powerful and
flourishing, but also, alas! one of the most factious
and turbulent of the cities of Europe. He
was but nine years old when he first met that
Beatrice Portinari who became thenceforth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
loadstar of his life. As to this lady we have
little to say. The details which Dante's early
biographers give us add but little to our knowledge
of her, and so far as they are not drawn
from the poet's own words, are merely such
graceful commonplaces of laudatory description
as any imagination of ordinary capacity would
spontaneously supply for itself. When we have
said that Beatrice was a beautiful, sweet, and
virtuous girl, we have said all that we know,
and all that we need care to know, of the daughter
of Folco Portinari, who lived, was married,
and died in Florence at the end of the thirteenth
century. All that she is to us more than other
Florentine maidens, she is to us through that
poet who, as he wept her untimely death, hoped
with no vain hope 'to write of her, what ne'er
was writ of woman.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It puts no great strain on our powers of
credence, to accept Dante's own statement of
the rush of almost stupefying emotions which
overwhelmed his childish heart when at the age
of nine he went with his father to Portinari's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
house, and was sent to play with other children,
amongst them the little Beatrice, a child of eight
years old. The 'New Life' waked within him
from that moment, and its strength and purity
made him strong and pure.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Nine more years have passed. Dante is
now eighteen. He has made rapid progress in
all the intellectual and personal accomplishments
which are held to adorn the position of a Florentine
gentleman. His teachers have in some
cases already discerned the greatness of his
powers, and he has become aware, probably by
essays which never saw the light, that he has not
only a poet's passions and aspirations, but a
poet's power of moulding language into oneness
with his thought. He and Beatrice know
each other by sight, as neighbours or fellow-citizens,
but Dante has never heard her voice
address a word to him. Yet she is still the
centre of all his thoughts. She has never ceased
to be to him the perfect ideal of growing womanhood,
and to his devout and fervid imagination,
just because she is the very flower of womanly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
courtesy, grace, and virtue, she is an angel upon
earth. Not in the hackneyed phrase of complimentary
commonplace, not in the exaggerated
cant of would-be poetical metaphor, but in the
deep verity of his inmost life, Dante Alighieri
believes that Beatrice Portinari, the maiden
whose purity keeps him pure, whose grace and
beauty are as guardian angels watching over his
life, has more of heaven than of earth about her
and claims kindred with God's more perfect
family.</p>

<p>Beatrice is now seventeen, she is walking
with two companions in a public place, she meets
Dante and allows herself to utter a few words of
graceful greeting. It is the first time she has
spoken to him, and Dante's soul is thrilled and
fired to its very depths. Not many hours afterwards,
the poet began the first of his sonnets that
we still possess, perhaps the first he ever wrote.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Let us pass over eight or nine years more.
Dante, now about twenty-six, is the very flower
of chivalry and poetry. The foremost men of
his own and other cities&mdash;artists, musicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
poets, scholars, and statesmen&mdash;are his friends.
Somewhat hard of access and reserved, but the
most fascinating of companions and the faithfulest
of friends to those who have found a real place
in his heart, Dante takes a rank of acknowledged
eminence amongst the poets of his day. His
verses, chiefly in praise of Beatrice, are written
in a strain of tender sentiment, that gives little
sign of what is ultimately to come out of him,
but there is a nervous and concentrated power
of diction, a purity and elevation of conception
in them, which may not have been obvious to
his companions as separating him from them,
but which to eyes instructed by the result is full
of deepest meaning.</p>

<p>And what of Beatrice? She is dead. It was
never given to Dante to call her his. We know
not so much as whether he even aspired to more
than that gracious salutation in which, to use
his own expression, he seemed to touch 'the
very limits of beatitude.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is certain that Beatrice
married a powerful citizen of Florence several
years before her death. But she was still the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
guardian angel of the poet's life, she was still
the very type of womanhood to him; and there
was not a word or thought of his towards her
but was full of utter courtesy and purity. And
now, in the flower of her loveliness she is cut
down by death, and to Dante life has become a
wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Yet eight or nine years more. Dante is
now in what his philosophical system regards
as the very prime of life.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He is thirty-five.
The date is 1300. Since we left him weeping
for the death of Beatrice, the unity of his life
has been shattered and he has lost his way, but
only for a time. Now his powers and purposes
are richer, stronger, more concentrated than ever.</p>

<p>In his first passion of grief for Beatrice's
death he had been profoundly touched by the
pity of a gentle-eyed damsel whom a far from
groundless conjecture identifies with Gemma
Donati, the lady whom he married not long
afterwards. With this Gemma he lived till his
banishment, and they had a numerous family.
The internal evidence of Dante's works, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
few circumstances really known to us, give little
support to the tradition that their marriage was
an unhappy one.</p>

<p>Dante's friends had hoped that domestic
peace might console him for his irreparable loss,
but he himself had rather sought for consolation
in the study of philosophy and theology;
and it befell him, he tells us, as one who in
seeking silver strikes on gold&mdash;not, haply, without
guidance from on high;&mdash;for he began to
see many things as in a dream, and deemed
that Dame Philosophy must needs be supreme!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>But neither domestic nor literary cares and
duties absorbed his energies. In late years he
had begun to take an active part in the politics
of his city, and was now fast rising to his true
position as the foremost man of Florence and of
Italy.</p>

<p>Thus, we see new interests and new powers
rising in his life, but for a time the unity of that
life was gone. While Beatrice lived Dante's
whole being was centred in her, and she was to
him the visible token of God's presence upon
earth, the living proof of the reality and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
beauty of things Divine, born to fill the world
with faith and gentleness. But when she was
gone, when other passions and pursuits disputed
with her memory the foremost place in Dante's
heart, it was as though he had lost the secret
and the meaning of life, as though he had lost
the guidance of Heaven, and was whirled helplessly
in the vortex of moral, social, and political
disorder which swept over his country. For
Italian politics at this period form a veritable
chaos of shifting combinations and entanglements,
of plots and counterplots, of intrigue and
treachery and vacillation, though lightened ever
and again by gleams of noblest patriotism and
devotion.</p>

<p>Yet Dante's soul was far too strong to be
permanently overwhelmed. Gradually his philosophical
reflections began to take definite shape.
He felt the wants of his own life and of his
country's life. He pierced down to the fundamental
conditions of political and social welfare;
and when human philosophy had begun to
restore unity and concentration to his powers,
then the sweet image of the pure maiden who
had first waked his soul to love returned glorified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and transfigured to guide him into the very
presence of God. She was the symbol of
Divine philosophy. She, and she only, could
restore his shattered life to unity and strength,
and the love she never gave him as a woman,
she could give him as the protecting guardian
of his life, as the vehicle of God's highest
revelation.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>With his life thus strengthened and enriched,
with a firm heart and a steady purpose, Dante
Alighieri stood in the year 1300 at the helm of
the State of Florence. And here accordingly
it becomes necessary for us to dwell for a
moment on some of the chief political forces
with which he had to deal.</p>

<p>The two great factions of the Guelfs and
Ghibellines were tearing the very heart of Italy;
and without going into any detail, we must try
to point out the central ideas of each party.
The Ghibellines, then, appear to have represented
an aristocratic principle of order, constantly in
danger of becoming oppressive, while the Guelfs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
represented a democratic principle of progress,
ever verging upon chaotic and unbridled licence.
The Ghibellines longed for a national unity,
resting on centralisation; the Guelfs aimed at a
local independence which tended to national
disintegration. The Ghibellines, regarding the
German Empire as the heir and representative
of the Empire of Rome, and as the symbol of
Italian unity, espoused the Emperor's cause
against the Pope, declared the temporal power
independent of the spiritual, and limited the
sphere of the priests entirely to the latter. The
Guelfs found in the political action of the Pope
a counterpoise to the influence of the Emperor;
the petty and intriguing spirit of the politics of
the Vatican made its ruler the natural ally of
the disintegrating Guelfs rather than the centralising
Ghibellines, and accordingly the Guelfs
ardently espoused the cause of the Pope's temporal
power, and often sought in the royal
house of France a further support against
Germany.</p>

<p>These broad lines, however, were constantly
blurred and crossed by personal intrigue or
ambition, by family jealousies, feuds, and rivalries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
by unnatural alliances or by corruption and
treachery.</p>

<p>Now Dante was by family tradition a Guelf.
Florence too was nominally the head quarters
of Guelfism, and Dante had fought bravely in
her battles against the Ghibellines. But the
more he reflected upon the sources of the evils
by which Italy was torn, the more profoundly he
came to distrust the unprincipled meddling of the
greedy princes of the house of France in Italian
politics, and the more jealously did he watch the
temporal power of the Pope. Perhaps the
political opinions he afterwards held were not as
yet fully consolidated, but his votes and proposals&mdash;which
we read with a strange interest in
the city archives of Florence nearly six hundred
years after the ink has dried&mdash;show that in 1300
he was at any rate on the highway to the conclusions
he ultimately reached. And we may
therefore take this occasion of stating what they
were.</p>

<p>It appeared to Dante that Italy was sunk
in moral, social, and political chaos, for want
of a firm hand to repress the turbulent factions
that rent her bosom; and that no hand except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
an Emperor's could be firm enough. The
Empire of Rome was to him the most imposing
and glorious spectacle offered by human history.
God had guided Rome by miracles and signs to
the dominion of the world that the world might
be at peace.</p>

<p>And parallel with this temporal Empire
founded by Julius Cæsar, was the spiritual Empire
of the Church, founded by Jesus Christ.
Both alike were established by God for the
guidance of mankind: to rebel against either was
to rebel against God. Brutus and Cassius, who
slew Julius Cæsar, the embodiment of the Empire,
are placed by Dante in the same depth of Hell
as Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ, the
incarnation of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> These three had
done what in them lay to reduce the world to
civil and religious chaos, for they had compassed
the death of the ideal representatives of civil and
religious order. But both powers alike laid a
mighty trust upon the human agents who administered
them; and as the Empire and the
Church were the sublimest and the holiest of
ideal institutions, so a tyrannical Emperor and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
corrupt or recreant Pope were amongst the
foulest of sinners, to be rebuked and resisted
with every power of body and soul.</p>

<p>Dante could no more conceive of the spiritual
life without the authoritative guidance of the all-present,
all-pervading Church, than he could conceive
of a well-ordered polity without the all-penetrating
force of law. But it appeared to
him as monstrous for the Pope to seek political
influence and to use his spiritual powers for
political ends as he would have judged it for the
Emperor to exercise spiritual tyranny over the
faith of Christians.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>There can have been little in the political
life of Florence at this time to attract one who
held such views. But Dante of all men hated
and despised weak shrinking from responsibility.
If there is one feature in his stern character
more awful than any other, it is his unutterable,
withering contempt for those who lived without
praise or blame, those wretches who never were
alive. He saw them afterwards in the outer
circle of Hell, mingled with that caitiff herd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
angels who were not for God and yet were not
for the rebels, but were only for themselves.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heaven drove them forth, Heaven's beauty not to stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would the deep Hell deign to have them there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For any glory that the damned might gain!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No fame of them survives upon the earth, Pity
and Justice hold them in disdain, their cries of
passion and of woe are ever whirled through the
starless air, and their forgotten lot appears to
them so base that they envy the very torments
of the damned. 'Let us not speak of them,'
says Virgil to Dante, 'but gaze and pass them
by.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>So Dante shrank not from his task when
called to public office, but laid his strong hand
upon the helm of Florence. During a part of
this year 1300, he filled the supreme magistracy,
and at that very time the old disputes of Guelf
and Ghibelline broke out in the city afresh
under a thin disguise. We have seen that
Dante's sympathies were now almost completely
Ghibelline, but as the first Prior of
Florence his duty was firmly to suppress all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
factious attempts to disturb the city's peace and
introduce intestine discord. It was not by
party broils that Italy would be restored to
peace and harmony. He behaved with a more
than Roman fortitude, for it is easier for a
father to chastise a rebellious son than for a
true friend to override the claims of friendship.
Dante's dearest friend, Guido Cavalcanti, bound
to him by every tie of sympathy and fellowship
which could unite two men in common purposes
and common hopes, was one of the leaders of
the party with which Dante himself sympathised;
and yet, for the good of his country and
in obedience to his magisterial duty, he tore this
friend from his side though not from his heart,
and pronounced on him the sentence of banishment,
the weight of which he must even then
have known so well. It speaks to the eternal
honour of Guido, as well as Dante, that this
deed appears not to have thrown so much as a
shadow upon the friendship of the two men.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Had Dante's successors in office dealt with
firmness and integrity equal to his own, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
might have been well; but a vacillating and
equivocal policy soon opened the door to suspicions
and recriminations, Florence ceased to
steer her own course and permitted foreign interference
with her affairs, while the Pope, with
intentions that may have been good but with a
policy which proved utterly disastrous, furthered
the intervention of the French Prince Charles of
Valois. It was a critical moment. An embassy
to the Papal Court was essential, and a firm
hand must meanwhile hold the reins at Florence.
'If I go, who shall stay? If I stay, who shall go?'
Dante is reported to have said; and though the
saying is probably apocryphal, yet it points out
happily enough the true position of affairs.
Dante was now no longer the chief magistrate
of his city, but he was in fact, though not in
name, the one man of Florence, the one man
of Italy.</p>

<p>Finally he resolved to go to Rome. But
the blindness or corruption of the Papal Court
was invincible; and while Dante was still
toiling at his hopeless task, Charles of Valois
entered Florence with his troops, soon to realise
the worst suspicions of those who had opposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
his intervention. Nominally a restorer of tranquillity,
he stirred up all the worst and most
lawless passions of the Florentines; and while
Dante was serving his country at Rome, the
unjust and cruel sentence of banishment was
launched against him, his property was confiscated
and seized, a few months afterwards he
was sentenced to be burned to death should he
ever fall into the power of the Florentines, and,
not content with all this, his enemies heaped
upon his name the foulest calumnies of embezzlement
and malversation&mdash;calumnies which
I suppose no creature from that hour to this has
ever for one moment believed, but which could
not fail to make the envenomed wound strike
deeper into Dante's heart.</p>

<p>So now he must leave 'all things most dear&mdash;this
the first arrow shot from exile's bow,' in
poverty and dependence his proud spirit must
learn 'how salt a taste cleaves to a patron's
bread, how hard a path to tread a patron's
stair;' and, above all, his unsullied purity and
patriotism must find itself forced into constant
association or even alliance with selfish and
personal ambition, or with tyranny, meanness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and duplicity.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> How that great soul bore itself
amid all these miseries, what it learnt from them,
where it sought and found a refuge from them,
we shall see when we take up again the broken
thread which we must drop to-day.</p>

DANTE'S LIFE AND PRINCIPLES<br />
<br />
<i>II. IN EXILE</i><br />
</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>
<p>A rapid sketch of the most decisive events
and the leading motives of the life of Dante
Alighieri has brought us to the eventful period
of his Priorate in 1300 and his banishment in
1302. His unsuccessful efforts to carry out
a firm and statesmanlike policy in Florence,
with the wreck of his own fortunes consequent
upon their failure, may be regarded as the
occasion if not the cause of his conceiving his
greatest work, the 'Divine Comedy.'</p>

<p>Nineteen years elapsed between Dante's
exile and his death, and both tradition and internal
evidence indicate that the main strength
of his life was poured during the whole of this
period into the channels already laid down in
its opening years. 'Forging on the anvil of
incessant toil' the several parts of his great
work, and 'welding them into imperishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
symmetry,'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the might of his intellect and the
passion of his heart grappled for nineteen years
with the task of giving worthy utterance to his
vast idea. Line by line, canto by canto, the
victory was won. Dante had shown that his
mother tongue could rise to loftier themes than
Greek or Roman had ever touched, and had
wrought out the fitting garb of a poem that
stands alone in the literature of the world in
the scope and sublimity of its conception.</p>

<p>Barely to realise what it was that Dante
attempted, wakes feelings in our hearts akin to
awe. When we think of that work and of the
man who, knowing what it was, deliberately set
himself to do it, an appalling sense of the presence
of overwhelming grandeur falls upon us,
as when a great wall of rocky precipice rises
sheer at our side, a thousand and yet a thousand
feet towards heaven. Our heads swim as we
gaze up to the sky-line of such a precipice, the
ground seems to drop from beneath our feet, all
our past and present becomes a dream, and our
very hold of life seems to slip away from us.
But the next moment a great exultation comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
rushing upon our hearts, with quickened pulses
and drawing deeper breath we rise to the sublimity
of the scene around us, and our whole
being is expanded and exalted by it. After
holding converse with such grandeur our lives
can never be so small again. And so it is when
the meaning of Dante's Comedy breaks upon us.
When we follow the poet step by step as he
beats or pours his thought into language, when
we note the firmness of his pace, the mastery
with which he handles and commands his
infinite theme, the unflinching directness, the
godlike self-reliance, with which he lays bare
the hearts of his fellow-men and makes himself
the mouthpiece of the Eternal, when we gaze
upon his finished work and the despair of Hell,
the yearning of Purgatory, the peace of Heaven,
sweep over our hearts, we are ready to whisper
in awe-struck exultation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What immortal hand or eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared form thy fearful symmetry?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The allegory with which the 'Divine Comedy'
opens, shadows forth the meaning and the purpose
of the whole poem. In interpreting it we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
may at first give prominence to its political
signification, not because its main intention
is certainly or probably political, but because
we shall thus be enabled to pass in due order
from the outer to the inner circle of the poet's
beliefs and purposes.</p>

<p>In the year 1300, then, Dante Alighieri
found that he had wandered, he knew not how,
from the true path of life, and was plunged into
the deadly forest of political, social, and moral
disorder which darkened with terrific shade
the fair soil of Italy. Deep horror settled upon
the recesses of his heart during the awful night,
but at last he saw the fair light of the morning
sun brightening the shoulders of a hill that
stretched above: this was the peaceful land of
moral and political order, which seemed to offer
an escape from the bitterness of that ghastly
forest. Gathering heart at this sweet sight,
Dante set himself manfully to work, with the
nether foot ever planted firmly on the soil, to
scale that glorious height. But full soon his
toilsome path would be disputed with him.
The dire powers of Guelfism would not allow
the restoration of peace and order to Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
His first foe was the incurable factiousness and
lightness of his own fair Florence. Like a
lithe and speckled panther it glided before him
to oppose his upward progress, and forced him
once and again to turn back upon his steps
towards that dread forest he had left. But though
forced back, Dante could not lose hope. Might
he not tame this wild but beauteous beast?
Yes; he might have coped with the fickle,
lustful, factious, envious but lovely Florence,
had not haughty France rushed on him like a
lion, at whose voice the air must tremble, had
not lean and hungry Rome, laden with insatiable
greed, skulked wolf-like in his path. It
was the wolf above all that forced him back
into the sunless depths of that forest of dismay,
and dashed to the ground his hopes of gaining
the fair height. When could he, when could
his Italy, rise from this chaos and be at peace?
Not till some great political Messiah should
draw his sword. With no base love of pelf or
thirst for land, but fed with wisdom, love, and
virtue, he should exalt the humbled Italy and
drive away her foes. Like a noble hound, he
should chase the insatiable wolf of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
greed from city to city back to the Hell from
which it came.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Dante's hope in this political Messiah rose
and fell, but never died in his heart. Now
with the gospel of Messianic peace, now with
the denunciation of Messianic judgment on his
lips, he poured out his lofty enthusiasm in those
apostolic and prophetic letters, some few of
which survive amidst the wrecks of time as
records of his changing moods and his unchanging
purposes.</p>

<p>Now one and now another of the Ghibelline
leaders may have seemed to Dante from time
to time to be the hero, the Messiah, for whom
he waited. But again and yet again his hopes
were crushed and blighted, and the panther, the
lion, and the wolf still cut off the approach to
that fair land.</p>

<p>More than once the poet's hopes must have
hung upon the fortunes of the mighty warrior
Uguccione, whose prodigies of valour rivalled the
fabled deeds of the knights of story. To this man
Dante was bound by ties of closest friendship;
to him he dedicated the Inferno, the first cantica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of his Comedy, and he may possibly have been
that hero ''twixt the two Feltros born'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to whom
Dante first looked to slay the wolf of Rome.</p>

<p>Far higher probably, and certainly far
better grounded, were the poet's hopes when
Henry VII. of Germany descended into Italy
to bring order into her troubled states. To
Dante, as we have seen, the Emperor was
Emperor of Rome and not of Germany. He
was Cæsar's successor, the natural representative
of Italian unity, the Divinely appointed
guardian of civil order. With what passionate
yearning Dante looked across the Alps for a
deliverer, how large a part of the woes of Italy
he laid at the feet of Imperial neglect, may be
gathered from many passages in his several
works; but nowhere do these thoughts find
stronger utterance than in the sixth canto of
the Purgatory. The poet sees the shades of
Virgil and the troubadour Sordello join in a
loving embrace at the bare mention of the name
of Mantua, where both of them were born.
'O Italy!' he cries, 'thou slave! thou hostelry
of woe! Ship without helmsman, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
tempest rude! No queen of provinces, but
house of shame! See how that gentle soul,
e'en at the sweet sound of his country's name,
was prompt to greet his fellow-citizen. Then
see thy living sons, how one with other ever is at
war, and whom the self-same wall and moat
begird, gnaw at each other's lives. Search,
wretched one, along thy sea-bound coasts, then
inward turn to thine own breast, and see if
any part of thee rejoice in peace. Of what
avail Justinian's curb of law, with none to
stride the saddle of command, except to
shame thee more? Alas! ye priests, who
should be at your prayers, leaving to Cæsar the
high seat of rule, did ye read well the word of
God to you, see ye not how the steed grows
wild and fell by long exemption from the
chastening spur, since that ye placed your hands
upon the rein? O German Albert! who abandonest,
wild and untamed, the steed thou
should'st bestride, may the just sentence from
the stars above fall on thy race in dire and
open guise, that he who follows thee may see
and fear. For, drawn by lust of conquest
otherwhere, thou and thy sire, the garden of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
empire have ye left a prey to desolation.
Come, thou insensate one, and see the Montagues
and Capulets, Monaldi, Philippeschi, for
all whom the past has sadness or the future fear.
Come, come, thou cruel one, and see oppression
trampling on thy faithful ones, and heal their
ills.... Come thou, and see thy Rome,
who weeps for thee, a lonely widow crying day
and night, "My Cæsar, wherefore hast thou left
me thus?" Come, see how love here governs
every heart! Or if our sorrows move thee not
at all, blush for thine own fair fame.&mdash;Nay,
let me say it: O Thou God Most High, Thou
Who wast crucified for us on earth, are Thy just
eyes turned otherwhither now? Or in the
depth of counsel dost Thou work for some good
end, clean cut off from our ken? For all
Italia's lands are full of tyrants, and every hind&mdash;so
he be factious&mdash;grows Marcellus-high.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Such was the cry for deliverance which went
up from Dante's heart to the Emperor. Picture
his hopes when Henry VII. came with the blessing
of the Pope, who had had more than his fill
of French influence at last, to bring peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
order into Italy; picture the exultation with
which he learnt alike from Henry's deeds and
words that he was just, impartial, generous, and
came not as a tyrant, not as a party leader,
but as a firm and upright ruler to restore prosperity
and peace; picture his indignation when
the incurable factiousness and jealousies of the
Italian cities, and of Florence most of all,
thwarted the Emperor at every step; picture the
bitterness of his grief when, after struggling nigh
three years in vain, Henry fell sick, and died at
Buonconvento. In Paradise the poet saw the
place assigned to 'Henry's lofty soul&mdash;his who
should come to make the crooked straight, ere
Italy was ready for his hand;' but the dream of
his throne on earth was broken for ever.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Henry died in 1313. This blow was followed
by the fall of Uguccione when he seemed
almost on the point of realising some of Dante's
dearest hopes. The poet and the warrior alike
found refuge at Verona now, with Can Grande
della Scala, to whom Dante dedicated the third
cantica of his Comedy, the Paradise.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
exile's hopes revive again at the Court of Verona?
Did the gallant and generous young soldier
whose gracious and delicate hospitality called
out such warm affection from his heart,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> seem
worthy to accomplish that great mission in which
Uguccione and Henry had failed? It is more
than probable that such thoughts found room in
Dante's sorrow-laden heart. And yet we cannot
but suppose that while his certainty remained
unshaken that in God's good time the deliverer
would come, yet the hopes which centred in any
single man must have had less and less assurance
in them as disappointment after disappointment
came.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, near the close of his life
Dante was still able to make Beatrice testify of
him in the courts of Heaven: 'Church militant
has not a son stronger in hope than he. God
knows it.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Simple as these words are, yet by
him who has scanned Dante's features and pondered
on his life, they may well be numbered
amongst those moving and strengthening human
utterances that ring like a trumpet through the
ages and call the soul to arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>But were Dante's hopes all concentrated on
the advent of that political Messiah who was
not to come in truth till our own day? Had
it been so, the 'Divine Comedy' would never
have been born.</p>

<p>When Dante realised his own helplessness
in the struggle against the panther of Florence,
the lion of France, and the wolf of Rome, when
he saw that to reorganise his country and remodel
the social and political conditions of life
would need the strong hand and the keen sword
of some great hero raised by God, he also saw
that for himself another way was opened, an
escape from that wild forest into which his feet
had strayed, an escape which it must be the
task of his life to point out to others, without
which the very work of the hero for whom he
looked would be in vain.</p>

<p>The deadly forest represented moral as well
as political confusion; the sunlit mountain, moral
as well as political order; and the beasts that cut
off the ascent, moral as well as political foes to
human progress.</p>

<p>From this moral chaos there was deliverance
for every faithful soul, despite the lion and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
wolf; and though the noble hound came not to
chase the foul beasts back to Hell, yet was
Dante led from the forest gloom even to the
light of Heaven.</p>

<p>And how was he delivered? By Divine
grace he saw Hell and Purgatory and Heaven&mdash;so
was he delivered. He saw the souls of
men stripped of every disguise, he saw their
secret deeds of good or ill laid bare. He
saw Popes and Emperors, ancient heroes and
modern sages, the rich, the valiant, the noble,
the fair of face, the sweet of voice; and no longer
dazzled, no longer overawed, he saw them as
they were, he saw their deeds, he saw the fruits
of them. So was he delivered from the entanglements
and perplexities, from the delusions
and seductions of the world, so were his feet set
upon the rock, so did he learn to sift the true
from the false, to rise above all things base, and
set his soul at peace, even when sorrow was
gnawing his heart to death. He, while yet
clothed in flesh and blood, went amongst the
souls of the departed, 'heard the despairing
shrieks of spirits long immersed in woe, who
wept each one the second death; saw suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
souls contented in the flames, for each one
looked to reach the realms of bliss, though long
should be the time,' and lastly he saw the souls
in Heaven, and gazed upon the very light of
God.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>All this he saw and heard under the guidance
of human and Divine philosophy, symbolised,
or rather concentrated and personified, in Virgil
and Beatrice.</p>

<p>Of Virgil, and the unique position assigned
to him in the Middle Ages, it is impossible here
to speak at length. Almost from the first publication
of the Æneid, and down to the time
when the revival of learning reopened the treasures
of Greek literature to Western Europe,
Virgil reigned in the Latin countries supreme
and unchallenged over the domain of poetry
and scholarship. Within two generations of his
own lifetime, altars were raised to him, by enthusiastic
disciples, as to a deity. When Christianity
spread, his supposed prediction of Christ
in one of the Eclogues endowed him with the
character of a prophet; and a magic efficacy
had already been attributed to verses taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
from his works. Throughout the Middle Ages,
his fame still grew as the supreme arbiter in
every field of literature, and as the repositary
of more than human knowledge, while fantastic
legends clustered round his name as the great
magician and necromancer. To Dante there
must also have been a special fascination in the
Imperial scope and sympathies of the Æneid;
for Virgil is pre-eminently the poet of the Roman
Empire. But we must not pause to follow out
this subject here. Suffice it that Dante felt for
Virgil a reverence so deep, an admiration so
boundless, and an affection so glowing, that he
became to him the very type of human wisdom
and excellence, the first agent of his rescue
from the maze of passion and error in which his
life had been entangled.</p>

<p>But Beatrice, the loved and lost, was the
symbol and the channel of a higher wisdom, a
diviner grace. She it was round whose sweet
memory gathered the noblest purposes and truest
wisdom of the poet's life. If ever he suffered
the intensity of his devotion to truth and virtue
for a moment to relax; if ever, as he passed
amongst luxurious courts, some siren voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
soothed his cares with a moment of unworthy
forgetfulness and ignoble ease; if ever he
suffered meaner cares or projects to draw him
aside so much as in thought from his great
mission, then it was Beatrice's glorified image
that recalled him in tears of bitter shame and
penitence to the path of pain, of effort, and of
glory. It was her love that had rescued him
from the fatal path; Virgil was but her agent
and emissary, and his mission was complete
when he had led him to her. Human wisdom
and virtue could guide him through Hell and
Purgatory, could show him the misery of sin,
and the need of purifying pain and fire, but it
was only in Beatrice's presence that he could
<i>feel</i> the utter hatefulness and shame of an
unworthy life, could <i>feel</i> the blessedness of
Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Under the guidance of Virgil and Beatrice,
then, Dante had seen Hell and Purgatory and
Heaven. This had snatched his soul from
death, had taught him, even in the midst of the
moral and political chaos of his age, how to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and after what to strive. Could he show others
what he himself had seen? Could he save
them, as he was saved, from the meanness,
from the blindness, from the delusions of the
life they led? He could. Though it should be
the toil of long and painful years, yet in the
passionate conviction of his own experience he
felt the power in him of making real to others
what was so intensely real to him. But what did
this involve? The truth if wholesome was yet
hard. He had dear and honoured friends whose
lives had been stained by unrepented sin, and
whose souls he had seen in Hell. Was he to
cry aloud to all the world that these loved ones
were amongst the damned, instead of tenderly
hiding their infirmities? Again, he was poor
and an exile, he had lost 'all things most dear,'
and was dependent for his very bread on the grace
and favour of the great; yet if he told the world
what he had seen, a storm of resentful hatred
would crash upon him from every region of
Italy. How would proud dames and lords
brook to be told of their dead associates in sin
and shame cursing their names from the very
depths of Hell, and looking for their speedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
advent there? How would pope and cardinal
and monarch brook to be told by the powerless
exile what he had heard from souls in Heaven,
in Purgatory, and in Hell? E'en let them brook
it as they might. His cry should be like the
tempest that sweeps down upon the loftiest
forest trees, but leaves the brushwood undisturbed.
The mightiest in the land should hear
his voice, and henceforth none should think that
loftiness of place or birth could shield the criminal.
He would tell in utter truth what he had
seen. He knew that power was in him to
brand the infamous with infamy that none
could wash away, to rescue the fair memory of
those the world had wrongfully condemned, to
say what none but he dare say, in verse which
none but he could forge, and bring all those
who hearkened through Hell and Purgatory
into Heaven.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>To deliver this message was the work of his
life, the end to which all his studies were directed,
from the time of his exile to that of his death.
Hence his studious labours came to have a
representative and vicarious character in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
mind. He was proudly conscious that he lived
and worked for mankind, and that his toil deserved
the grateful recognition of his city and
his country.</p>

<p>This trait of his character comes out with
striking force in the noble letter which he wrote
in answer to the proffered permission to return
to his beloved Florence, but upon disgraceful
conditions which he could not accept. The
offer came when his fortunes were at their lowest
ebb. Henry VII. was dead, Uguccione had lost
his power. All hope of the exile's returning in
triumph seemed at an end. Then came the
offer of a pardon and recall, for which he had
longed with all the passionate intensity of his
nature. And yet it was but a mockery. It was
a custom in Florence upon the Day of St. John
the Baptist, the patron saint of the city, to release
certain malefactors from the public gaols
on their performing set acts of contrition; and
a decree was passed that all the political exiles
might return to their home on St. John's Day in
1317 if they would pay a sum of money, walk in
procession, with tapers in their hands and with
other tokens of guilt and penitence, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
church, and there offer themselves as ransomed
malefactors to the saint.</p>

<p>Many of the exiles accepted the terms, but
Dante's proud and indignant refusal shows us a
spirit unbroken by disappointment and disaster,
scorning to purchase ease by degradation. 'Is
this,' he cries to the friend who communicated
to him the conditions upon which he might
return, 'is this the glorious recall by which
Dante Alighieri is summoned back to his country
after well-nigh fifteen years of exile? Is
this what innocence well known to all, is this
what the heavy toil of unbroken study, has
deserved? Far be it from him who walks as
her familiar with Philosophy to stoop to the base
grovelling of a soul of clay and suffer himself
thus to be treated like a vile malefactor. Far
be it from the preacher of justice, when suffering
outrage, to pay the acknowledgment of fair
desert to the outrageous.</p>

<p>'Not by this path can I return. But let a
way be found that hurts not Dante's honour
and fair fame, and I will tread it with no tardy
feet. If no such road leads back to Florence,
then will I never enter Florence more. What!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
can I not gaze, wherever I may be, upon the
spectacle of sun and stars? Can I not ponder on
the sweetest truths in any region under heaven,
but I must first make myself base and vile
before the people of the State of Florence?'<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Such was the answer of Dante Alighieri to
that cruel insult which makes our cheeks glow
even now with indignation. Such was the
temper of the man who had seen Hell and
Purgatory and Heaven, and who shrank not
from the utterance of all that he had seen.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dante must now have been engaged in writing
the Paradise. Amongst the sufferings and
burdens which were fast drawing him to the
grave, amongst the agonies of indignation, of
regret, of hope, of disappointment which still
wracked his soul, the deep peace of God had
come upon him; beneath a storm of passion at
which our hearts quail was a calm of trustful
self-surrender which no earthly power could
disturb; for the harmonies of Paradise swelled
in the poet's heart and sought for utterance in
these last years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>But though his spirit was thus rapt to Heaven,
he never lost his hold upon the earth;
never disdained to toil as best he might for the
immediate instruction or well-being of his kind.
More than once his eloquence and skill enabled
him to render signal service to his protectors
in conducting delicate negotiations, and at the
same time to further that cause of Italian unity
which was ever near his heart. Nor did the
progress of his great work, the Comedy, withhold
him from a varied subsidiary activity as a
poet, a moralist, and a student of language
and science.</p>

<p>One characteristic example of this by-work
must suffice. In the last year but one of his life
when he must have been meditating the last,
perhaps the sublimest, cantos of the Paradise,
when he might well have been excused if he had
ceased to concern himself with any of the lower
grades of truth, he heard a certain question of
physics discussed and re-discussed, and never
decided because of the specious but sophistical
arguments which were allowed to veil it in
doubt. The question was whether some portions
of the sea are or are not at a higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
level than some portions of the land; and Dante,
'nursed from his boyhood in the love of truth,'
as he says, 'could not endure to leave the question
unresolved, and determined to demonstrate
the facts and to refute the arguments alleged
against them.'<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Accordingly he defended his
thesis on a Sunday in one of the churches of
Verona under the presidency of Can Grande.</p>

<p>This essay is a model of close reasoning and
sound scientific method, and the average nineteenth
century reader, with the average contempt
for fourteenth century science, would find much
to reflect upon should he read and understand
it. The vague and inconclusive style of reasoning
against which Dante contends is still rampant
everywhere, though its forms have changed;
while the firm grasp of scientific method and
the incisive reasoning of Dante himself are still
the exception in spite of all our modern training
in research.</p>

<p>Thus Dante was engaged to the last upon
the whole field of human thought. Such was
the scope and power of his mind that he could
embrace at the same moment the very opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
poles of speculation; and such was his passion
for truth that, when gazing upon the very
presence of God, he could not bear to leave men
in error when he could set them right, though it
were but as to the level of the land and sea.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But we must hasten to a close. Let us turn
from the consideration of Dante's work to a
picture of personal character drawn by his own
hand. It is his ideal of a life inspired by that
'gentleness' for which, since the days of chivalry,
we have had no precise equivalent in language,
and which is itself too rare in every age.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Cherishing such an ideal, Dante wandered
from court to court of Italy, finding here and
there a heart of gold, but for the most part
moving amongst those to whom grace and purity
and justice were but names. Can we wonder
that sometimes the lonely exile felt as if his own
sorrow-laden heart were the sole refuge upon
earth of love and temperance?</p>

<p>Three noble dames, he tells us&mdash;noble in
themselves but in nought else, for their garments
were tattered, their feet unshod, their hair dishevelled,
and their faces stained with tears&mdash;came
and flung themselves at the portal of his
heart, for they knew that Love was there. Moved
with deep pity, Love came forth to ask them of
their state. They were Rectitude, Temperance,
and Generosity, once honoured by the world, now
driven out in want and shame, and they came
there for refuge in their woe. Then Love, with
moistened eyes, bade them lift up their heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
If they were driven begging through the world,
it was for men to weep and wail whose lives
had fallen in such evil times; but not for them,
hewn from the eternal rock&mdash;it was not for them
to grieve. A race of men would surely rise
at last whose hearts would turn to them again.
And hearing thus how exiles great as these were
grieved and comforted, the lonely poet thought
his banishment his glory.</p>

<p>Yet when he looked for his sweet home and
found it not, the agony that could not break
his spirit fast destroyed his flesh, and he knew
that death had laid the key upon his bosom.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>When this sublime and touching poem was
composed we have no means of knowing, but it
can hardly have been long before the end.
When that end came, Dante can barely have
completed his great life work, he can barely have
written the last lines of the 'Divine Comedy.'
He had been on an unsuccessful mission in the
service of his last protector, Guido da Polenta
of Ravenna. On his return he was seized with
a fatal illness, and died at Ravenna in 1321, at
the age of fifty-six.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Who can grudge him his rest? As we read the
four tracts of the 'Convito,' which were to have
been the first of fourteen, but must now remain
alone, as we are brought to a sudden stand at
the abrupt termination of his unfinished work
on the dialects and poetry of Italy,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> as we ponder
on the unexhausted treasures that still lay in
the soul of him who could write as Dante wrote
even to the end, we can hardly suppress a sigh
to think that our loss purchased his rest so soon.
But his great work was done; he had told his
vision, that men might go with him to Hell, to
Purgatory, and to Heaven, and be saved from all
things base. Then his weary head was laid down
in peace, and his exile was at an end. 'That fair
fold in which, a lamb, he lay'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was never opened
to him again, but he went home, and the blessings
of the pure in heart and strong in love go
with him.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The thoughts with which we turn from the
contemplation of Dante's life and work find utterance
in the lines of Michael Angelo. 'The works
of Dante were unrecognised, and his high purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
by the ungrateful folk whose blessing rests
on all&mdash;except the just. Yet would his fate
were mine! For his drear exile, with his virtue
linked, glad would I change the fairest state on
earth.'</p>

<h2>III<br />
<br />
HELL<br />
</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>
<p>The first cantica of the 'Divine Comedy'&mdash;the
Inferno or Hell&mdash;is the best known of all
Dante's works in prose or verse, in Latin or
Italian; and though students of Dante may
sometimes regret this fact, yet no one can be
at a moment's loss to understand it.</p>

<p>For the attributes of heart and brain requisite
for some kind of appreciation of the Inferno are
by many degrees more common than those to
which the other works of Dante appeal. It is
easy to imagine a reader who has not even
begun truly to understand either the poet or the
poem nevertheless rendering a sincere tribute of
admiration to the colossal force of the Inferno,
and feeling the weird spell of fascination and
horror ever tightening its grasp on him as he
descends from circle to circle of that starless
realm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no mystery in the inveterate tendency
to regard Dante as pre-eminently the poet
of Hell. Nor is it a new phenomenon. Tradition
tells of the women who shrank aside as Dante
passed them by, and said one to another, shuddering
as they spoke, 'See how his black hair
crisped in the fire as he passed through Hell!'
But no tradition tells of awe-struck passers-by
who noted that the stains had been wiped from
that clear brow in Purgatory, that the gleam of
that pure and dauntless eye had been kindled
in Heaven.</p>

<p>The machinery of the Inferno, then, is moderately
familiar to almost all. Dante, lost in the
darksome forest, scared from the sunlit heights
by the wild beasts that guard the mountain
side, meets the shade of Virgil, sent to rescue
him by Beatrice, and suffered by Omnipotence
to leave for a time his abode in the limbo of
the unbaptised, on this mission of redeeming
love. Virgil guides Dante through the open
gate of Hell, down through circle after circle of
contracting span and increasing misery and sin,
down to the central depth where the arch-rebel
Satan champs in his triple jaws the arch-traitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
against Church and State, Judas Iscariot, and
Brutus and Cassius.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Through all these circles Dante passes under
Virgil's guidance. He sees and minutely describes
the varying tortures apportioned to the
varying guilt of the damned, and converses
with the souls of many illustrious dead in
torment.</p>

<p>And is this the poem that has enthralled and
still enthrals so many a heart? Are we to look
for the strengthening, purifying, and uplifting of
our lives, are we to look for the very soul of poetry
in an almost unbroken series of descriptions,
unequalled in their terrible vividness, of ghastly
tortures, interspersed with tales of shame, of
guilt, of misery? Even so. And we shall not
look in vain.</p>

<p>But let us listen first to Dante's own account
of the subject-matter of his poem. Five words
of his are better than a volume of the commentators.
'The subject of the whole work, literally
accepted,' he says, 'is the state of souls after
death.... But if the work is taken allegorically
the subject is <span class="smcap">Man</span>, as rendering himself liable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
by good or ill desert in the exercise of his free
will, to rewarding or punishing justice.'<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>According to Dante, then, the real subject
of the Inferno is 'Man, as rendered liable, by ill
desert in the exercise of his free will, to punishing
justice.' Surely a subject fraught with unutterable
sadness, compassed by impenetrable
mystery, but one which in the hands of a prophet
may well be made to yield the bread of
life; a subject fitly introduced by those few
pregnant words, 'The day was going, and the
dusky air gave respite to the animals that are
on earth from all their toils; and I alone girt
me in solitude to bear the strain both of the
journey and the piteous sight, which memory
that errs not shall retrace.'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Now if this be the true subject of the poem,
it follows that all those physical horrors of
which it seems almost to consist must be strictly
subordinate to something else, must be part of
the machinery or means by which the end of
the poet is reached, but in no way the end
itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>If the subject of the poem is a moral one,
then the descriptions of physical torment and
horror must never even for a moment overbalance
or overwhelm the true 'motive' of the
work, must never even for a moment so crush
or deaden the feelings as to render them incapable
of moral impressions, must never in a
single instance leave a prevailingly physical
impression upon the mind.</p>

<p>And it is just herein that the transcendent
power of the Inferno is displayed. Horrors
which rise and ever rise in intensity till they
culminate in some of the ghastliest scenes ever
conceived by mortal brain are from first to last
held under absolute control, are forced to support
and intensify moral conceptions which in
less mighty hands they would have numbed and
deadened.</p>

<p>Oh, the pity of this sin, the unutterable, indelible
pity of it! Its wail can never be stilled
in our hearts while thought and memory remain.
The misery of some forms of sin, the foul
shame of others, the vileness, the hatefulness,
the hideous deformity of others yet&mdash;this, and
not horror at the punishment of sin, is what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Dante stamps and brands upon our hearts as
we descend with him towards the central depths,
stamps and brands upon our hearts till the pity,
the loathing, the horror can endure no more;&mdash;then
in the very depth of Hell, at the core of
the Universe, with one mighty strain that leaves
us well-nigh spent, we turn upon that central
point, and, leaving Hell beneath our feet, ascend
by the narrow path at the antipodes.</p>

<p>With the horror and the burden of the starless
land far off, we lift up our eyes again to
see the stars, and our souls are ready for the
purifying sufferings of Purgatory.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Sometimes the tortures of the damned are
a mere physical translation, so to speak, of their
crimes. Thus the ruthless disseminators of
strife and dissension who have torn asunder
those who belonged one to another, those who
had no proper existence apart from one another,
are in their turn hewn and cleft by the avenging
sword; and ever as their bodies reunite and their
wounds are healed, the fierce blow falls again.
Amongst them Dante sees the great troubadour
Bertram de Born, who fostered the rebellion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the sons of our own king Henry II. In that
he made father and son each other's enemy, his
head is severed from his trunk, his brain from
its own root.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In other cases a transparent metaphor or
allegory dictates the form of punishment; as
when the hypocrites crawl in utter weariness
under the crushing weight of leaden garments,
shaped like monkish cloaks and cowls, and all
covered with shining gold outside.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Or when
the flatterers and sycophants wallow in filth
which fitly symbolises their foul life on earth.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>It is probable that some special significance
and appropriateness might be traced in almost
all the forms of punishment in Dante's Hell,
though it is not always obvious. But one thing
at least is obvious: the uniform congruousness of
the impression which the physical and moral
factors of each description combine to produce.
In fact, the Inferno is an account of 'man, as deserving
ill by the exercise of his free will,' in which
all the external surroundings are brought into
precise accord with the central conception. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
tortures are only the background; and as in the
picture of a great artist, whether we can trace
any special significance and appropriateness in
the background or not, we always feel that it
supports the true subject of the picture and
never overpowers it, so it is here. Man as misusing
his free will. This is the real subject of
the Inferno. All else is accessory and subordinate.</p>

<p>But if this be so, we should expect to
find an endless variety and gradation, alike
of guilt and punishment, as we pass through
the circles of Hell. And so we do. At
one moment indignation and reproof are all
swallowed up in pity, and the suffering of the
exiled soul only serves to quicken an infinite
compassion in our hearts, a compassion not so
much for the punishment of sin as for sin itself
with its woeful loss and waste of the blessings
and the holiness of life. At another moment
we are brought face to face with a wretch whose
tortures only serve to throw his vileness into
sharper relief; and when we think of him and of
his deeds, of him and of his victims, we can
understand those awful words of Virgil's when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Dante weeps, 'Art thou too like the other fools?
The death of pity is true pity here.'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Infinite
pity would indeed embrace the most abandoned,
but it is only weak and misdirected pity that
wakes or slumbers at the dictate of mere
suffering.</p>

<p>And as there is infinite variety of guilt and
woe, so is there infinite variety of character in
Dante's Hell. Though the poet condemns with
sternest impartiality all who have died in unrepented
sin, yet he recognises and honours the
moral distinctions amongst them. What a difference,
for instance, between the wild blaspheming
robber Vanni Fucci,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the defiant
Capaneus,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> a prototype of Milton's Satan, the one
incited by the bestial rage of reckless self-abandonment,
the other by the proud self-reliance of a
spirit that eternity cannot break&mdash;alike in their
defiance of the Almighty, but how widely
severed in the sources whence it springs.</p>

<p>Look again where Jason strides. The
wrongs he did Medea and Hypsipyle have condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
him to the fierce lash under which his
base companions shriek and fly; but he, still
kingly in his mien, without a tear or cry bears
his eternal pain.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>See Farinata, the great Florentine&mdash;in his
ever burning tomb he stands erect and proud, 'as
holding Hell in great disdain;' tortured less by
the flames than by the thought that the faction
he opposed is now triumphant in his city; proud,
even in Hell, to remember how once he stood
alone between his country and destruction.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>See again where Pietro delle Vigne, in the
ghastly forest of suicides, longs with a passionate
longing that his fidelity at that time when
he 'held both the keys of the great Frederick's
heart' should be vindicated upon earth from
the unjust calumnies that drove him to self-slaughter.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>And see where statesmen and soldiers of
Florence, themselves condemned for foul and
unrepented sin, still love the city in which they
lived, still long to hear some good of her. As
the flakes of fire fall 'like snow upon a windless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
day' on their defenceless bodies, see with
what dismay they gaze into one another's
eyes when Dante brings ill news to them of
Florence.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>In a word, the souls in Hell are what they
were on earth, no better and no worse. This is
the key-note to the comprehension of the poem.
No change has taken place; none are made
rebels to God's will, and none are brought into
submission to it, by their punishment; but all
are as they were. Even amongst the vilest
there is only the rejection of a thin disguise,
no real increase of shamelessness. Many souls
desire to escape notice and to conceal their
crimes, just as they would have done on
earth; many condemn their evil deeds and are
ashamed of them, just as they would have
been on earth; but there is no change of character,
no infusion of a new spirit either for good
or ill; with all their variety and complexity of
character, the unrepentant sinners wake in Hell
as they would wake on earth our mingled pity
and horror, our mingled loathing and admiration.
Man as misusing his free will, in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
scope and variety of the infinite theme, is the
subject of the poem.</p>

<p>And this brings us to another consideration:
the eternity of Dante's Hell. Those who know
no other line of Dante, know the last verse of
the inscription upon the gate of Hell: 'All hope
relinquish, ye that enter here.' The whole inscription
is as follows: 'Through me the way
lies to the doleful city; through me the way
lies to eternal pain; through me the way lies
'mongst the people lost. 'Twas justice moved
my Lofty Maker; Divine Power made me,
Wisdom Supreme and Primal Love. Before
me were no things created, save things eternal;
and I, too, last eternal. All hope relinquish,
ye that enter here.'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The gates of Hell reared by the Primal
Love! If we believe in the eternity of sin and
evil, the eternity of suffering and punishment
follows of necessity. To be able to acquiesce
in the one, but to shrink from the thought of
the other, is sheer weakness. The eternity and
hopelessness of Dante's Hell are the necessary
corollaries of the impenitence of his sinners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
To his mind wisdom and love cannot exist
without justice, and justice demands that eternal
ill-desert shall reap eternal woe.</p>

<p>But how could one who so well knew what
an eternal Hell of sin and suffering meant,
believe it to be founded on eternal love? Why
did not Dante's heart in the very strength of
that eternal love rebel against the hideous
belief in eternal sin and punishment? I cannot
answer the question I have asked. Dante
believed in the Church, believed in the theology
she taught, and could not have been what
he was had he not done so. Had he rejected
any of the cardinal beliefs of the Christianity of
his age and rebelled against the Church, he
might have been the herald of future reformations,
but he could never have been the index
and interpreter to remotest generations of that
mediæval Catholic religion of which his poem is
the very soul.</p>

<p>Meanwhile note this, that if ever man realised
the awful mystery and contradiction involved
in the conception of a good God
condemning the virtuous heathen to eternal
exile, that man was Dante. If ever heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
man was weighed down beneath the load of pity
for the damned, that heart was Dante's. The
virtuous heathen he places in the first round
of Hell; here 'no plaint is to be heard except
of sighs, which make the eternal air to tremble;'
here, with no other torture than the death of
hope without the death of longing, they live in
neither joy nor sorrow, eternal exiles from the
realms of bliss.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Dante, as we shall see hereafter, longed with
a passionate thirsty longing to know how the
Divine justice could thus condemn the innocent.
But his thirst was never slaked. It was and
remained an utter mystery to him; and there
are few passages of deeper pathos than those
in which he remembers that his beloved and
honoured guide and master, even Virgil, the
very type of human wisdom and excellence, was
himself amongst these outcasts.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Again and again, as we pass with Dante
through the circles of Hell, we feel that his
yearning pity for the lost, racking his very soul
and flinging him senseless to the ground for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
misery, shows an awakening spirit which could
not long exist in human hearts without teaching
them that God's redeeming pity is greater and
more patient than their own. So, too, when
Francesca and Paolo, touched by Dante's pitying
sympathy, exclaim, 'Oh, thou gracious being,
if we were dear to God, how would we pray for
thee!'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who can help feeling that Dante was
not far from the thought that all souls are dear
to God?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, how strong that faith which
could lift up all this weight of mystery and woe,
and still believe in the Highest Wisdom and the
Primal Love! Only the man who knew the holiness
of human life to the full as well as he knew
its infamy, only the man who had seen Purgatory
and Heaven, and who had actually felt the love
of God, could know that with all its mystery
and misery the universe was made not only by
the Divine Power, but by the Supreme Wisdom
and the Primal Love, could weave this Trinity
of Power, Wisdom, Love, into the Unity of the
all-sustaining God, who made both Heaven and
Hell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>And we still have to face the same insoluble
mystery. The darker shade is indeed lifted
from the picture upon which we gaze; we have
no eternal Hell, no eternity of sin, to reckon
with; but to us too comes the question, 'Can
the world with all its sin and misery be built
indeed upon the Primal Love?' And our answer
too must be the answer not of knowledge
but of faith. Only by making ourselves God's
fellow workers till we <i>feel</i> that the Divine
Power and the Primal Love are one, can we
gain a faith that will sustain the mystery it
cannot solve. Alas! how often our weaker
faith fails in its lighter task, how often do we
speak of sin and misery as though they were
discoveries of yesterday that had brought new
trials to our faith, unknown before; how often
do we feel it hard to say even of earth what
Dante in the might of his unshaken faith could
say of Hell itself&mdash;that it is made by Power,
Wisdom, Love!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But perhaps we have dwelt too long already
on this topic, and in any case we must now
hasten on. Dante's Hell, as we have seen, represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
sinful and impenitent humanity with all
its fitting surroundings and accessories, cut off
from everything that can distract the attention,
confuse the moral impression, or alleviate its
appalling strength. And as the magic power of
his words, with the absolute sincerity and clearness
of his own conceptions, forces us to realise
the details of his vision as if we had trodden every
step of the way with him, this result follows
amongst others: that we realise, with a vividness
that can never again grow dim, an existence without
any one of those sweet surroundings and
embellishments of human life which seem the fit
support and reflection of purity and love.</p>

<p>We have been in a land where none of the fair
sounds or sights of nature have access, no flowers,
no stars, no light, and if there are streams and
hills there they are hideously transformed into
instruments and emblems not of beauty but of
horror. We are made to realise all this, and to
feel that it is absolutely and eternally fitting as
the abode of sin and of impenitence. And
when once this association has been stamped
upon our minds, the beauty and the sweetness
of the world in which we live gain a new meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
for us. They become the standing protest
of all that is round us against every selfish, every
sinful thought or deed; the standing appeal to
us to bring our souls into sweet harmony with
their surroundings, since God in His mercy
brings not their surroundings into ghastly harmony
with them.</p>

<p>When we have been with the poor wretch,
deep down in Hell, who gasps in his burning
fever for 'the rivulets that from the green slopes
of Casentino drop down into the Arno, freshening
the soft, cool channels, where they glide,'<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and
have realised that in that land there are not and
ought not to be the cooling streams and verdant
slopes of earth; we can never again enjoy the
sweetness and the peace of nature without our
hearts being consciously or unconsciously purified,
without every evil thing in our lives feeling
the rebuke.</p>

<p>When we have known what it is to be in a
starless land, and have felt how strange and
incongruous the fair sights of Heaven would be,
have felt that they would have no place or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
meaning there, have felt that cheerless gloom
alone befits the souls enveloped there, then
when we leave the dreary realms, and once more
gaze upon the heavens by night and day, they
are more to us than they have ever been
before, they are indeed what Dante so often
calls them, using the language of the falconers,
the <i>lure</i> by which God summons back our
wayward souls from vain and mean pursuits.</p>

<p>Look, again, upon this fearful picture. Dante
and Virgil come to a black and muddy lake in
which the passionate tear and smite one another
in bestial rage; and all over its surface are
bubbles rising up. They come from the cries
of the morose and sullen ones 'who are fixed in
the slime at the bottom of the lake. They cry:
"Gloomy we were in the sweet air that the sun
gladdens, bearing in our hearts the smoke of
sullenness; now we are gloomy here in the
black slime"&mdash;such is the strain that gurgles in
their throats, but cannot find full utterance.'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
Who that has seen those bubbles rise upon
the lake can ever suffer himself again to cherish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
sullenness within his heart without feeling at the
very instant the rebuke of the 'sweet air that
the sun gladdens,' and thinking of that gurgling
strain of misery?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Another of the lessons taught by the Inferno
is, that no plea, however moving, can avail the
sinner, or take away the sinfulness of sin, that
no position can place him above punishment,
that no authority can shield him from it.</p>

<p>The guilty love of Francesca and Paolo, so
strong, so deathless in that it was love, has sunk
them to Hell instead of raising them to Heaven
in that it was guilty. Stronger to make them
one than Hell to sever them, it is powerless to
redeem the sin to which it has allied itself, and
its tenderness has but swelled the eternal anguish
of those whom it still joins together, because it
has suffered the sanctuary of life, which love
is set to guard, to be polluted and betrayed.
Sung in those strains of deathless tenderness
and pity where 'tears seem to drop from the
very words,' the story of this guilty love reveals
the fatalest of all mischoice, and tells us that no
passion, however wild in its intensity, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
innocent in its beginnings, however unpremeditated
in its lawless outburst, however overmastering
in its pleas, however loyal to itself in
time and in eternity, may dare to raise itself
above the laws of God and man, or claim immunity
from its wretched consequences for those
who are its slaves. How infinite the pity and
the waste, how irreparable the loss, when the
love that might have been an ornament to
Heaven, adds to the unmeasured guilt and
anguish of Hell a wail of more piercing sorrow
than rings through all its lower depths!</p>

<p>Nor could any height of place claim exemption
from the moral law. Dante was a Catholic,
and his reverence for the Papal Chair was deep.
But against the faithless Popes he cherished a
fiery indignation proportioned to his high estimate
of the sacred office they abused. In one
of the most fearful passages of the Inferno he
describes, in terms that gain a terrible significance
from one of the forms of criminal execution
practised in his day, how he stood by a
round hole in one of the circles of Hell, in which
Pope Nicholas III. was thrust head foremost&mdash;stood
like the confessor hearing the assassin's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
final words, and heard the guilty story of Pope
Nicholas.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>It is characteristic of Dante that he tells
us here, as if quite incidentally, that these holes
were about the size of the baptising stands or
fonts in the Church of San Giovanni, 'one of
which,' says he, 'I broke not many years ago to
save one who was drowning in it. Let this
suffice to disabuse all men.' Evidently he had
been taxed with sacrilege for saving the life
of the drowning child at the expense of the
sacred vessel, and it can hardly be an accident
that he recalls this circumstance in the Hell of
the sacrilegious Popes and Churchmen. These
men, who had despised their sacred trust and
turned it to basest trafficking, were the representatives
of that hard system of soulless officialism
that would pollute the holiest functions of
the Church, while reverencing with superstitious
scruple their outward symbols and instruments.</p>

<p>And if the Papal office could not rescue the
sinner that held it, neither could the Papal
authority shield the sins of others. It is said
that Catholics have not the keeping of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
consciences. Dante at least thought they had.
In the Hell of fraudulent counsellors, wrapped
in a sheet of eternal flame one comes to him and
cries, 'Grudge not to stay and speak with me a
while. Behold, I grudge it not, although I burn.'
It is Guido da Montefeltro, whose fame in council
and in war had gone forth to the ends of the
earth. All wiles and covert ways he knew, and
there had ever been more of the fox than of the
lion in him. But when he saw himself arriving
at that age when every man should lower sails
and gather in his ropes, then did he repent of all
that once had pleased him, and girding him with
the cord of St. Francis he became a monk.
Alas! his penitence would have availed him well
but for the Prince of the new Pharisees, Pope
Boniface VIII., who was waging war with
Christians that should have been his friends,
hard by the Lateran. 'He demanded counsel of
me,' continues Guido, 'but I kept silence, for his
words seemed drunken. Then he said to me,
"Let not thy heart misdoubt: henceforth do I
absolve thee, but do thou teach me so to act
that I may cast Prenestina to the ground.
Heaven I can shut and open, as thou knowest."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
... Then the weighty arguments impelled me
to think silence worse than speech; and so I said,
"Father, since thou dost cleanse me from that
guilt wherein I now must fall, long promise and
performance short will make thee triumph in thy
lofty seat." Then when I died St. Francis came
for me, but one of the black cherubim said to him:
"Do me no wrong, nor take thou him away.
He must come down amongst my menials, e'en
for the fraudulent advice he gave, since when
I have kept close upon his hair. He who repents
not cannot be absolved, nor can one will
the same thing he repents, the contradiction not
permitting it." Ah wretched me! how did I
shudder then, for he laid hold of me, and with
the cry, "Haply thou knew'st not I was a
logician?" bore me to judgment.'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Who can fail to recognise the utter truth of
Dante's teaching here? What can stand between
a man's own conscience and his duty? Though
the very symbol and mouthpiece of the collective
wisdom and piety of Christendom should
hold the shield of authority before the culprit,
yet it cannot ward off the judgment for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
single deed done in violation of personal moral
conviction. When once we have realised the
meaning of this awful passage, how can we ever
urge again as an excuse for unfaithfulness to
our own consciences, that the assurance of those
we loved and reverenced overcame our scruples?
Here as everywhere Dante strips sin of every
specious and distracting circumstance, and shows
it to us where it ought to be&mdash;in Hell.</p>

<p>Contrast with the scene we have just looked
upon the companion picture from the Purgatory;
where Buonconte di Montefeltro tells how he
fled on foot from the battle-field of Campaldino,
his throat pierced with a mortal wound ensanguining
the earth. Where Archiano falls into the
Arno there darkness came upon him, and he fell
crossing his arms upon his breast and calling on
the name of Mary with his last breath. 'Then,'
he continues, 'God's angel came and took me,
and Hell's angel shrieked, "O thou of Heaven,
wherefore dost thou rob me? Thou bear'st
with thee the eternal part of him, all for one
wretched tear which saves it from me. But
with the other part of him I'll deal in other
fashion."' Upon which the infuriated demon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
swells the torrent with rain, sweeps the warrior's
body from the bank, dashes away the hateful
cross into which its arms are folded, and in
impotent rage rolls it along the river bed and
buries it in slime so that men never see it more;
but the soul is meanwhile saved.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Here we must pause. I have made no
attempt to give a systematic account of the
Inferno, still less to select the finest passages
from it. I have only tried to interpret some of
the leading thoughts which run through it, some
of the deep lessons which it can hardly fail to
teach the reader.</p>

<p>Like all great works, the Inferno should be
studied both in detail and as a whole in order
to be rightly understood; and when we understand
it, even partially, when we have been with
Dante down through all the circles to that central
lake of ice in which all humanity seems
frozen out of the base traitors who showed no
humanity on earth, when we have faced the icy
breath of the eternal air winnowed by Satan's
wings, and have been numbed to every thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and feeling except one&mdash;one which has been
burned and frozen into our hearts through all
those rounds of shame and woe&mdash;the thought of
the pity, the misery, the hatefulness of sin;
then, but then only, we shall be ready to
understand the Purgatory, shall know something
of what the last lines of the Inferno
meant to Dante: 'We mounted up, he first
and second I, until through a round opening
I saw some of those beauteous things that
Heaven bears; and thence we issued forth again
to see the stars.'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<h2>IV<br />
<br />
PURGATORY<br />
</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>'Leaving behind her that so cruel sea, the
bark of poesy now spreads her sails to speed
o'er happier waters; and I sing of that mid
kingdom where the soul of man is freed from
stain, till worthy to ascend to Heaven.'<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Such
are the opening words of Dante's Purgatory,
and they drop like balm upon our seared and
wounded hearts when we have escaped from
the dread abode of eternal ill-desert.</p>

<p>'Man, atoning for the misuse of his free will,'
may be regarded as the subject of this poem.
And it brings it in a sense nearer to us than either
the Hell or the Paradise. Perhaps it ought not
to surprise us that the Purgatory has not by any
means taken such a hold of the general imagination
as the Hell, and that its machinery and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
incidents are therefore far less widely known;
for the power of the Purgatory does not overwhelm
us like that of the Inferno whether we
understand or no. There are passages indeed
in the poem which take the reader by storm
and force themselves upon his memory, but as a
whole it must be felt in its deeper spiritual
meaning to be felt at all. Its gentleness is
ultimately as strong as the relentless might of
the Hell, but it works more slowly and takes
time to sink into our hearts and diffuse its
influence there. Nor again need we be surprised
that the inner circle of Dante students
often concentrate their fullest attention and
admiration upon the Paradise, for it is the
Paradise in which the poet is most absolutely
unique and unapproached, and in it his admirers
rightly find the supreme expression of
his spirit.</p>

<p>And yet there is much in the Purgatory
that seems to render it peculiarly fitted to
support our spiritual life and help us in our
daily conflict, much which we might reasonably
have expected would give its images and allegories
a permanent place in the devout heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Christendom; for, as already hinted, it is nearer
to us in our struggles and imperfections, in
our aspirations and our conscious unworthiness,
nearer to us in our love of purity and our knowledge
that our own hearts are stained with sin,
in our desire for the fullness of God's light, and
our knowledge that we are not yet worthy or
ready to receive it; it is nearer to us in its
piercing appeals, driven home to the moral experience
of every day and hour, nearer to us in
its mingled longing and resignation, in its mingled
consolations and sufferings, nearer to us in
its deep unrest of unattained but unrelinquished
ideals, than either the Hell in its ghastly
harmony of impenitence and suffering, or the
Paradise in its ineffable fruition.</p>

<p>Moreover, the allegorical appropriateness of
the various punishments is far more obvious
and simple, and the spiritual significance of the
whole machinery clearer and more direct, in the
Purgatory than in the Hell. In a word, the
Purgatory is more obviously though not more
truly, more directly though not more profoundly,
moral and spiritual in its purport than the Hell.</p>

<p>Dante addresses some of the sufferers on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the fifth circle of Purgatory as 'chosen ones of
God whose pains are soothed by justice and by
hope.'<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And in truth the spirits in Purgatory
are already utterly separated from their sins in
heart and purpose, are already chosen ones of
God. They are deeply sensible of the justice
of their punishment, and they are fed by the
certain hope that at last, when purifying pain
has done its work, their past sins will no longer
separate them from God, they will not only be
parted in sympathy and emotion from their own
sinful past, but will be so cut off from it as no
longer to feel it as their own, no longer to recognise
it as a part of themselves, no longer to
be weighed down by it. Then they will rise
away from it into God's presence. 'Repenting
and forgiving,' says one of them, 'we passed
from life, at peace with God, who pierces our
hearts with longing to see Him.'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The souls in Purgatory, then, are already
transformed by the thirst for the living water,
already filled with the longing to see God,
already at one with Him in will, already
gladdened by the hope of entering into full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
communion with Him. But they do not wish to
go into His presence yet. The sense of shame
and the sense of justice forbid it. They feel
that the unexpiated stains of former sin still
cleave to them, making them unfit for Heaven,
and they love the purifying torments which are
burning those stains away. In the topmost
circle of Purgatory, amongst the fierce flames
from which Dante would have hurled himself
into molten glass for coolness, he sees souls
whose cheeks flush at the memory of their sin
with a shame that adds a burning to the burning
flame; whilst others, clustering at the edge
that they may speak with him, yet take good
heed to keep within the flame, lest for one
moment they should have respite from the
fierce pain which is purging away their sins and
drawing them nearer to their desire.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Sweet hymns of praise and supplication are
the fitting solace of this purifying pain; and as
Dante passes through the first of the narrow
ascents that lead from circle to circle of
Purgatory, he may well contrast this place of
torment with the one that he has left, may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
exclaim, 'Ah me! how diverse are these straits
from those of Hell!'<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Penitence, humility, and peace&mdash;though not
the highest or the fullest peace&mdash;are the key-notes
of the Purgatory.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>When Dante issued from the deadly shades
of Hell, his cheeks all stained with tears, his
eyes and heart heavy with woe, his whole frame
spent with weariness and agony, the sweet blue
heavens stretched above him, and his eyes, that
for so long had gazed on nought but horror,
rested in their peaceful depths; Venus, the
morning star, brightened the east, and the
Southern Cross poured its splendour over the
heavens; daybreak was at hand, and the poets
were at the foot of the mount of Purgatory.</p>

<p>The sea rippled against the mountain, and
reeds, the emblems of humility, ever yielding
to the wave that swept them, clustered round
the shore. Dante and Virgil went down to the
margin, and there the living poet bathed away
the stains and tears of Hell.</p>

<p>Ere long the waves were skimmed by a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
bark, a radiant angel standing in the prow,
bearing the souls of the redeemed, who must
yet be purified, singing the psalm, 'When Israel
came out of Egypt.' Amongst the shades thus
borne to the mount of purification was Dante's
friend Casella, the singer and musician. How
often had his voice lulled all Dante's cares to
sleep, and 'quieted all his desires,' and now it
seemed as though he were come to bring his
troubled heart to peace, to rest him in his utter
weariness of body and of soul.</p>

<p>So, at his entreaty, Casella raised his voice,
and all the shades gathered entranced around
him as he sang a noble canzone composed by
Dante himself in years gone by.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The sweet
sound never ceased to echo in the poet's memory&mdash;not
even the ineffable harmonies of Paradise
drowned those first strains of peace that soothed
him after his awful toil.</p>

<p>But Purgatory is no place of rest, and
Casella's song was rudely interrupted by the
guardian of the place, who cried aloud, 'How
now, ye sluggard souls! What negligence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
what delay is here? Speed to the mountain!
Rid you of the crust that lets not God be
manifest to you!' To purge away our sins is
not to rest; and no longing for repose must
tempt us to delay even for a moment.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Dante draws no flattering picture of the
ease of self-purification; Hell itself hardly gives
us such a sense of utter weariness as the first
ascent of the mount of Purgatory. Virgil is
on in front, and Dante cries out, altogether
spent, 'Oh, my sweet father, turn thou and behold
how I am left alone unless thou stay;' but
Virgil still urges him on, and after a time comforts
him with the assurance that though the
mountain is so hard to scale at first, yet the
higher a man climbs the easier the ascent
becomes, till at last it is so sweet and easy to
him that he rises without effort as a boat drops
down the stream: then he may know that the end
of his long journey has come, that the weight
of sin is cast off, that his soul obeys its own
pure nature, and rises unencumbered to its
God.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The lower portion of the mountain forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
kind of ante-Purgatory, where the souls in weary
exile wait for admission to the purifying pain for
which they long. Here those who have delayed
their penitence till the end of life atone for their
wilful alienation by an equal term of forced
delay ere they may enter the blessed suffering
of Purgatory. Here those who have lived in
contumacy against the Church expiate their
offences by a thirty-fold exile in the ante-Purgatory;
but as we saw in Hell that Papal
absolution will not shield the sinful soul, so we
find in Purgatory that the Papal malediction,
the thunders of excommunication itself, cannot
permanently part the repentant soul from the
forgiving God.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>When this first exile is at an end, and the
lower mountain scaled, the gate of the true
Purgatory is reached. Three steps lead up to
it, 'the first of marble white, so polished and so
smooth that in it man beholds him as he is.'
This represents that transparent simplicity and
sincerity of purpose that, throwing off all self-delusion,
sees itself as it is, and is the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
step towards true penitence. 'The second
step, darker than purpled black, of rough and
calcined stone, all rent through length and
breadth,' represents the contrite heart of true
affliction for past sin. 'The third and crowning
mass methought was porphyry, and flamed like
the red blood fresh spouting from the vein.'
This is the glowing love which crowns the work
of penitence, and gives the earnest of a new and
purer life. Above these steps an angel stands
to whom Peter gave the keys&mdash;the silver key of
knowledge and the golden key of authority&mdash;bidding
him open to the penitent, and err
rather towards freedom than towards over-sternness.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Within the gate of Purgatory rise the seven
terraces where sin is purged. On the three
lower ledges man atones for that perverse and
ill-directed love which seeks another's ill&mdash;for
love of some sort is the one sole motive of all
action, good or bad.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> In the lowest circle the
pride that rejoices in its own superiority, and
therefore in the inferiority of others, is purged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and expiated. 'As to support a ceiling or a
roof,' says Dante, 'one sees a figure bracket-wise
with knees bent up against it bosom, till
the imaged strain begets real misery in him
who sees, so I beheld these shades when close
I scanned them. True it is that less or greater
burdens cramped each one or less or more, yet
he whose mien had most of patience, wailing
seemed to say, "I can no more!"'<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In the second circle the blind sin of envy is
expiated. Here the eyelids of the envious are
ruthlessly pierced and closed by the stitch of an
iron wire, and through the horrid suture gush
forth tears of penitence that bathe the sinner's
cheeks. 'Here shall my eyes be closed,' says
Dante, half in shame at seeing those who saw
him not, 'here shall my eyes be closed, though
open now&mdash;but not for long. Far more I dread
the pain of those below; for even now methinks
I bend beneath the load.'<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In the third circle the passionate wend their
way through a blinding, stinging smoke, darker
than Hell; but all are one in heart, and join in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
sweet accord of strain and measure singing the
'Agnus Dei.'</p>

<p>In these three lower circles is expiated the
perverse love that, in pride, in envy, or in passion,
seeks another's ill.</p>

<p>Round the fourth or central ledge hurry in
ceaseless flight the laggards whose feeble love of
God, though not perverse, was yet inadequate.</p>

<p>Then on the succeeding circles are punished
those whose sin was excessive and ill-regulated
love of earthly things.</p>

<p>There in the fifth round the avaricious and
the prodigal, who bent their thoughts alike to
the gross things of earth and lost all power of
good, lie with their faces in the dust and their
backs turned to heaven, pinioned and helpless.</p>

<p>In the sixth circle the gluttonous in lean and
ghastly hunger gaze from hollow eyes 'like
rings without the gems,' upon the fruit they may
not taste.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>And lastly, in the seventh circle the sin of
inchastity is purged, in flames as fierce as its
own reckless passion.</p>

<p>Through all of these circles to which its life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
on earth has rendered it liable, the soul must
pass, in pain but not in misery; at perfect
peace with God, loving the pain that makes it
fit to rise into His presence, longing for that
more perfect union, but not desiring it as yet
because still knowing itself unworthy.</p>

<p>At last the moment comes when this shrinking
from God's presence, this clinging to the
pain of Purgatory, has its end. The desire to
rise up surprises the repentant soul, and that
desire is itself the proof that the punishment is
over, that the soul is ripe for Heaven. Then,
as it ascends, the whole mountain shakes from
base to summit with the mighty cry of 'Gloria
in excelsis!' raised by every soul in Purgatory
as the ransomed and emancipated spirit seeks
its home.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Through all these circles Dante is led by
Virgil, and here as in Hell he meets and converses
with spirits of the departed. He displays
the same unrivalled power and the same relentless
use of it, the same passionate indignation,
the same yearning pity, which take the soul
captive in the earlier poem. In the description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of Corso Donati's charger dragging his mangled
body towards the gorge of Hell in ever fiercer
flight; in the indignant protest against the
factious spirit of Italy and the passionate appeal
to the Empire; in the description of the impotent
rage of the fiend who is cheated by 'one
wretched tear' of the soul of Buonconte; in the
scathing denunciations of the cities of the Arno;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
in these and in many another passage the poet
of the Purgatory shows that he is still the poet
of the Hell; but it is rather to the richness of
the new thoughts and feelings than to the unabated
vigour and passion of the old ones, that
we naturally direct our attention in speaking of
the Purgatory. And these we have by no
means exhausted.</p>

<p>When Dante first entered the gate of Purgatory
he heard 'voices mingled with sweet
strains' chanting the Te Deum, and they raised
in his heart such images as when we hear voices
singing to the organ and 'partly catch and
partly miss the words.'<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> And this sweet music,
only to find its fullest and distinctest utterance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in the Paradise, pervades almost the whole of
the Purgatory, filling it with a reposeful longing
that prepares for the fruition it does not give.</p>

<p>There is a tender and touching simplicity in
the records of their earthly lives which the gentle
souls in Purgatory give to our poet. Take as
an example, the story of Pope Adrian V., whom
Dante finds amongst the avaricious: 'A month
and little more I felt the weight with which the
Papal mantle presses on his shoulders who would
keep it from the mire. All other burdens seem
like feathers to it. Ah me! but late was my
conversion; yet when I became Rome's Shepherd
then I saw the hollow cozenage of life; for
my heart found no repose in that high dignity,
and yonder life on earth gave it no room to aim
yet higher; wherefore the love of this life rose
within me. Till then was I a wretched soul
severed from God, enslaved to avarice, for which,
thou seest, I now bear the pain.'<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Most touching too are the entreaties of the
souls in Purgatory for the prayers of those on
earth, or their confession that they have already
been lifted up by them. 'Tell my Giovanna to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
cry for me where the innocent are heard,' says
Nino to Dante;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and when the poet meets his
friend Forese, who had been dead but five years,
in the highest circle but one of Purgatory, whereas
he would have expected him still to be in exile
at the mountain's base, he asks him to explain
the reason why he is there, and Forese answers,
'It is my Nella's broken sobs that have brought
me so soon to drink the sweet wormwood of
torment. Her devout prayers and sighs have
drawn me from the place of lingering, and freed
me from the lower circles. My little widow,
whom I greatly loved, is all the dearer and
more pleasing to God because her goodness
stands alone amid surrounding vice.'<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Surely it is a deep and holy truth, under
whatever varying forms succeeding ages may
embody it, that the faithful love of a pure soul
does more than any other earthly power to
hasten the passage of the penitent through
Purgatory. When under the load of self-reproach
and shame that weighs down our souls,
we dare not look up to Heaven, dare not look
into our own hearts, dare not meet God, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the faithful love of a pure soul can raise us up
and teach us not to despair of ourselves, can
lift us on the wings of its prayer, can waft us on
the breath of its sobs, swiftly through the purifying
anguish into the blissful presence of God.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A feature of special beauty in the Purgatory
is formed by the allegorical or typical sculptures
on the wall and floor of some of the terraces, by
the voices of warning or encouragement that
sweep round the mountain, and by the visions
that from time to time visit the poet himself.
Let one of these visions suffice. Dante is about
to enter the circles in which the inordinate love
of earthly things, with all vain and vicious indulgence,
is punished. 'In dream there came
to me,' he says, 'a woman with a stuttering
tongue, and with distorted eyes, all twisted on
her feet, maimed in her hands, and sallow in her
hue. I gazed at her, and as the sun comforts
the chilled limbs by the night oppressed, so did
my look give ease unto her speech, and straightway
righted her in every limb, and with love's
colours touched her haggard face. And when
her speech was liberated thus, she sang so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sweetly it were dire pain to wrest attention from
her. "I," she sang, "am that sweet siren who
lead astray the sailors in mid sea, so full am I
of sweetness to the ear. 'Twas I that drew
Ulysses from his way with longing for my song;
and he on whom the custom of my voice has
grown, full rarely leaves me, so do I content
him."' In the end this false siren is exposed in
all her foulness, and Dante turns from her in
loathing.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Throughout Purgatory Dante is still led and
instructed by Virgil. I think there is nothing
in the whole Comedy so pathetic as the passages
in which the fate of Virgil, to be cut off for ever
from the light of God, is contrasted with the
hope of the souls in Purgatory. The sweetness
and beauty of Virgil's character as conceived by
Dante grow steadily upon us throughout this
poem, until they make the contemplation of his
fate and the patient sadness with which he
speaks of it more heartrending than anything
that we have heard or seen in Hell. After this
we hardly need to hear from Dante the direct
expression he subsequently gives of his passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
thirst to know the meaning of so mysterious
a decree as that which barred Heaven against
the unbaptised.</p>

<p>In Purgatory, Virgil and Dante meet the
emancipated soul of the Roman poet Statius,
freed at last after many centuries of purifying
pain, and ready now to ascend to Heaven.
Virgil asks him how he became a Christian, and
Statius refers him to his own words in one of
the Eclogues, regarded in those days as containing
a prophecy of Christ. 'Thou,' says Statius,
'didst first guide me to Parnassus to drink in its
grottoes, and afterwards thou first didst light me
unto God. When thou didst sing, "The season
is renewed, justice returns, and the first age of
man, and a new progeny descends from Heaven,"
thou wast as one who, marching through the
darkness of the night, carries the light behind
him, aiding not himself, but teaching those who
follow him the way. Through thee was I a poet,
and through thee a Christian.' Not a shade of
envy, not a thought of resentment or rebellion,
passes over Virgil's heart as he hears that while
saving others he could not save himself.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>But now, without dwelling further on the
episodes of the poem, we must hasten to consider
the most beautiful and profoundest of its closing
scenes.</p>

<p>Under Virgil's guidance Dante had traversed
all the successive circles of the mount of Purgatory.
He stood at its summit, in the earthly
Paradise, the Garden of Eden which Eve had
lost. There amid fairest sights and sounds he
was to meet the glorified Beatrice, and she was
to be his guide in Heaven as Virgil had been his
guide in Hell and Purgatory.</p>

<p>In any degree to understand what follows
we must try to realise the intimate blending of
lofty abstract conceptions and passionate personal
emotions and reminiscences in Dante's
thoughts of Beatrice.</p>

<p>This sweet and gentle type of womanhood,
round whose earthly life the genius and devotion
of Dante have twined a wreath of the tenderest
poetry, the most romantic love, that ever rose
from heart of man, had been to him in life and
death the vehicle and messenger of God's highest
grace. Round her memory clustered all the
noblest purposes and purest motives of his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and in her spirit seemed to be reflected the
divinest truth, the loftiest wisdom, that the
human soul could comprehend. And so, making
her objectively and in the scheme of the universe
what she had really been and was to him subjectively,
he came to regard her as the symbol
of Divine philosophy as Virgil was the symbol
of human virtue and wisdom.</p>

<p>Touched by the glow of an ideal love, Dante
had reached a deeper knowledge, a fuller grace,
than the wisdom of this world could teach or
gain. The doctors of the Church, the sweet
singers, the mighty heroes, the profound philosophers,
who had instructed and supported him,
had none of them touched his life so deeply,
had none of them led him so far into the secret
place of truth, had none of them brought him
so near to God, as that sweet child, that lovely
maid, that pure woman, who had given him his
first and noblest ideal.</p>

<p>Now to Dante and to his age it was far from
unnatural to erect concrete human beings into
abstract types or personifications. Leah and
Rachel are the active and the contemplative life
respectively. Virgil, we have seen, is human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
philosophy. Cato of Utica represents the
triumph over the carnal nature and the passions.
And it is not only the Old Testament
and classical antiquity that furnish these types.
The celebrated Countess Matilda, who lived only
about two centuries before Dante himself, becomes
in his poem, according to the generally
received interpretation, one of the attributes of
God personified. And so Beatrice became the
personification of that heavenly wisdom, that
true knowledge of God, of which she had been
the vehicle to Dante.</p>

<p>But to the poet and to the age in which he
lived, it was impossible to separate this heavenly
wisdom in its simple, spiritual essence, from the
form which its exposition had received at the
hands of the great teachers of the Church. To
them true spiritual wisdom, personal experience
and knowledge of God, were inseparable from
<i>theology</i>. The two united in the conception of
Divine philosophy. Thus by a strange but intelligible
gradation Dante blended in his conception
of Beatrice two elements which seem to
us the very extreme of incompatibility. She is
in the first place the personification of scholastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
theology, with all its subtle intricacy of pedantic
method; she is in the second place the maiden
to whom Dante sang his songs of love in
Florence, and whose early death he wept disconsolate.
And in the closing scenes of the
Purgatory these two conceptions are more intimately
blended, perhaps, than anywhere else
in Dante's writings.</p>

<p>After wandering, as it were, in the forest of
a bewildered life, the poet is led through Hell
and Purgatory until he stands face to face at
last with his own purest and loftiest ideal; and
the fierceness of his own self-accusation when
thus confronted with Beatrice he expresses
under the form of reproaches which he lays
upon <i>her</i> lips, but which we must retranslate
into the reproachful utterances of his own tortured
heart, if we are to retain our gentle
thoughts of Beatrice.</p>

<p>We need not dwell even for a moment on
the gorgeous pageantry with which Dante introduces
and surrounds Beatrice. Suffice it to say
that she comes in a mystic car, which represents
the Church, surrounded by saints and angels.</p>

<p>No sooner does Dante see her, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
closely veiled, than the might of the old passion
sweeps upon him, and like a child that flees in
terror to its mother, so does he turn to Virgil
with the cry: 'Not one drop of blood but trembles
in my veins! I recognise the tokens of
the ancient flame.' But Virgil is gone. Dante
has no refuge from his own offended and reproachful
ideal. As he bursts into lamentations
at the loss of Virgil's companionship, Beatrice
sternly calls him back: 'Dante! weep not that
Virgil has gone from thee. Thou hast a deeper
wound for which to weep.'</p>

<p>As one who speaks, but holds back words
more burning than he utters, so she stood. A
clear stream flowed between her and Dante, and
as she began to renew her reproaches he cast
down his eyes in shame upon the water;&mdash;but
there he saw himself! The angels sang a
plaintive psalm, and Dante knew that they were
pleading for him more clearly than if they had
used directer words. Then the agony of shame
and penitence that Beatrice's reproof had frozen
in his bosom, as when the icy north wind freezes
the snow amid the forests of the Apennine, was
melted by the angels' plea for him as snow by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the breezes of the south, and burst from him in a
convulsion of sobs and tears.</p>

<p>How was it possible that he should have
gone so far astray, have been so false to the
promise and the purpose of his early life, have
abused his own natural gifts and the superadded
grace of heaven? How was it possible that he
should have let all the richness of his life run
wild? That after Beatrice had for a time sustained
him and led him in the true path with her
sweet eyes, he should have turned away from
her in Heaven whom he had so loved on earth?
How could he have followed the false semblances
of good that never hold their word?
His visions and his dreams of the ideal he was
deserting had not sufficed, and so deep had he
sunk that nothing short of visiting the region of
the damned could save him from perdition.
Why had he deserted his first purposes? What
obstacle had baffled or appalled him? What
new charm had those lower things of earth obtained
to draw him to them? 'The false enticements
of the present things,' he sobbed, 'had
led his feet aside, soon as her countenance was
hid.' But should not the decay of that fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
form have been itself the means of weaning him
from things of earth, that he might ne'er again
be cheated by their beauty or drawn aside by
them from the pursuit of heavenly wisdom and
of heavenly love? When the fairest of all earthly
things was mouldering in the dust, should he
not have freed himself from the entanglements
of the less beauteous things remaining?</p>

<p>To all these reproaches, urged by Beatrice,
Dante had no reply. With eyes rooted to the
ground, filled with unutterable shame, like a
child repentant and confessing, longing to throw
himself at his mother's feet, but afraid to meet
her glance while her lips still utter the reproof,
so Dante stood. From time to time a few
broken words, which needed the eye more than
the ear to interpret them, dropped from his
lips like shafts from a bow that breaks with
excess of strain as the arrow is delivered.</p>

<p>At last Beatrice commanded him to look up.
The wind uproots the oak tree with less resistance
than Dante felt ere he could turn his
downcast face to hers; but when he saw her,
transcending her former self more than her
former self transcended others, his agony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
self-reproach and penitence was more than he
could bear, and he fell senseless to the ground.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>When he awoke he was already plunged in
the waters of Lethe, which with the companion
stream of Eunoë would wash from his memory
the shame and misery of past unfaithfulness,
would enable him, no longer crushed by self-reproach,
to ascend with the divine wisdom and
purity of his own ideal into the higher realms.</p>

<p>And here the Purgatory ends, the Paradise
begins.</p>

HEAVEN<br />
</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<p>When Dante wrote the Paradise, he well knew
that he was engaged in the supreme effort of his
life, to which all else had led up. He well knew
that he was engaged in no pastime, but with
intensest concentration of matured power was
delivering such a message from God to man as
few indeed had ever been privileged or burdened
to receive. He well knew that the words
in which through long years of toil he had distilled
the sweetness and the might of his vision
were immortal, that to latest ages they would
bear strength and purity of life, would teach the
keen eye of the spirit to gaze into the uncreated
light, and would flood the soul with a joy deeper
than all unrest or sorrow, with a glory that no
gloom could ever dispel. He knew moreover
that this his last and greatest poem would speak
to a few only in any generation, though speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to those few with a voice of transforming
power and grace.</p>

<p>'Oh, ye,' he cries almost at the beginning of
the Paradise, 'who, desirous to hear, have followed
in slight bark behind my keel, which
sings upon its course, now turn you back and
make for your own shores, trust not the open
wave lest, losing me, ye should be left bewildered.
As yet all untracked is the wave I sail.
Minerva breathes, Apollo leads me on, and the
nine Muses point me to the pole. Ye other
few, who timely have lift up your heads for
bread of angels fed by which man liveth but
can never surfeit know, well may ye launch
upon the ocean deep, keeping my furrow as ye
cut your way through waters that return and
equal lie.'<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In these last words, comparing the track he
leaves to the watery furrow that at once subsides,
Dante seems to indicate that he was well aware
how easily the soul might drop out of his verses,
how the things he had to say were essentially
unutterable, so that his words could at best
be only a suggestion of his meaning dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
for their effect upon the subtlest spiritual influences
and adjustments, as well as upon the
receptive sympathy of those to whom they were
addressed. And if there are so many that fail
to catch the spirit and feel the heavenly harmony
of the music when it is Dante's own hand
that touches the strings, how hopeless seems the
task of transferring even its echo, by translated
extracts, or descriptions, from which the soul
has fled.</p>

<p>There is indeed much that is beautiful, much
that is profound, in the Paradise which is capable
of easy reproduction, but the divine aroma
of the whole could only be translated or transferred
by another Dante. Petal after petal of
the rose of Paradise may be described or copied,
but the heavenly perfume that they breathed is
gone.</p>

<p>'His glory that moves all things,' so Dante
begins the Paradise, 'pierces the universe; and
is here more, here less resplendent. In that
Heaven which of His light has most, was I.
There I saw things which he who thence descends
has not the knowledge or power to retell.
For as it draws anigh to its desire, our intellect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
pierces so deep that memory cannot follow in its
track. But of that sacred empire so much as I
had power in my mind to store, shall now be
matter of my poesy.'<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>And again, almost at the close he sings, 'As
is he who dreams, and when the dream is broke
still feels the emotion stamped upon his heart
though all he saw is fled beyond recall, e'en
such am I; for, all the vision gone well-nigh
without a trace, yet does the sweetness that was
born of it still drop within my heart.'<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>If so much as an echo of that echo, if so
much as a dream of that dream, falls upon our
ears and sinks into our hearts, then we are
amongst those few for whom Dante wrote his
last and his divinest poem.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Through the successive heavens of Paradise
Dante is conducted by Beatrice; and here again
the intimate blending in the divine guide of two
distinct almost contradictory conceptions forms
one of the great obstacles towards giving an
intelligible account of the poem. This obstacle
can only disappear when patient study guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
by receptive sympathy has led us truly into the
poet's thought.</p>

<p>In the Paradise, however, the allegorical and
abstract element in the conception of Beatrice is
generally the ruling one. She is the impersonation
of Divine Philosophy, under whose
guidance the spiritual discernment is so quickened
and the moral perceptions so purified, that
the intellect can thread its way through subtlest
intricacies of casuistry and theology, and where
the intellect fails the eye of faith still sees.</p>

<p>Even in this allegorical character Beatrice is
a veritable personality, as are Lucia, the Divine
Grace, and the other attributes or agents of the
Deity, who appear in the Comedy as personal
beings with personal affections and feelings,
though at the same time representing abstract
ideas. Thus Beatrice, as Divine Philosophy
impersonated, is at once an abstraction and a
personality. 'The eyes of Philosophy,' says
Dante elsewhere, 'are her demonstrations, the
smile of Philosophy her persuasions.'<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> And this
mystic significance must never be lost sight of
when we read of Beatrice's eyes kindling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
an ever brighter glow and her smile beaming
through them with a diviner sweetness as she
ascends through heaven after heaven ever nearer
to the presence of God. The demonstrations of
Divine Philosophy become more piercing, more
joyous, more triumphant, her persuasions more
soul-subduing and entrancing, as the spirit draws
nearer to its source.</p>

<p>But though we shall never understand the
Paradise unless we perceive the allegorical significance
and appropriateness not only of the
general conception of Beatrice, but also of many
details in Dante's descriptions of her, yet we
should be equally far from the truth if we
imagined her a mere allegory. She is a glorified
and as it were divine <i>personality</i>, and watches
over and guides her pupil with the tenderness
and love of a gentle and patient mother. The
poet constantly likens himself to a wayward, a
delirious, or a frightened child, as he flies for
refuge to his blessed guide's maternal care.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Again, they are in the eighth heaven, and
Beatrice knows that a glorious manifestation of
saints and angels is soon to be vouchsafed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Dante. Listen to his description of her as she
stands waiting: 'E'en as a bird amongst the
leaves she loves, brooding upon the nest of her
sweet young throughout the night wherein all
things are hid, foreruns the time to see their loved
aspect and find them food, wherein her heavy
toil is sweet to her, there on the open spray,
waiting with yearning longing for the sun,
fixedly gazing till the morn shall rise; so did
she stand erect, her eyes intent on the meridian.
And seeing her suspended in such longing I
became as one who yearns for what he knows
not, and who rests in hope.'<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Under Beatrice's guidance, then, Dante
ascends through the nine heavens into the empyrean
heights of Paradise. Here in reality are
the souls of all the blessed, rejoicing in the
immediate presence and light of God,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and here
Dante sees them in the glorified forms which
they will wear after the resurrection. But in
order to bring home to his human understanding
the varied grades of merit and beatitude in
Paradise, he meets or appears to meet the souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of the departed in the successive heavens
through which he passes, sweeping with the
spheres in wider and ever wider arc, as he rises
towards the eternal rest by which all other
things are moved.</p>

<p>It is in these successive heavens that Dante
converses with the souls of the blessed. In the
lower spheres they appear to him in a kind of
faint bodily form like the reflections cast by
glass unsilvered; but in the higher spheres
they are like gems of glowing light, like stars
that blaze into sight or fade away in the depths
of the sky; and these living topaz and ruby
lights, like the morning stars that sing together
in Job, break into strains of ineffable praise and
joy as they glow upon their way in rhythmic
measure both of voice and movement.</p>

<p>Thus in the fourth Heaven, the Heaven of the
Sun, Dante meets the souls of the great doctors
of the Church. Thomas Aquinas is there, and
Albertus Magnus and the Venerable Bede and
many more. A circle of these glorious lights is
shining round Dante and Beatrice as Aquinas
tells the poet who they were on earth. 'Then
like the horologue, that summons us, what hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the spouse of God rises to sing her matins to
her spouse, to win his love, wherein each part
urges and draws its fellow, making a tinkling
sound of so sweet note that the well-ordered
spirit swells with love: so did I see the glorious
wheel revolve, and render voice to voice in
melody and sweetness such as ne'er could noted
be save where joy stretches to eternity.</p>

<p>'Oh, senseless care of mortals! Ah, how
false the thoughts that urge thee in thy downward
flight! One was pursuing law, and medicine
one, another hunting after priesthood, and a
fourth would rule by force or fraud; one toiled in
robbery, and one in civil business, and a third
was moiling in the pleasures of the flesh all
surfeit-weary, and a fourth surrendered him to
sloth. And I the while, released from all these
things, thus gloriously with Beatrice was received
in Heaven.'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>When Beatrice fixes her eyes&mdash;remember
their allegorical significance as the demonstrations
of Divine philosophy&mdash;upon the light of
God, and Dante gazes upon them, then quick
as thought and without sense of motion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
two arise into a higher heaven, like the arrow
that finds its mark while yet the bow-string
trembles; and Dante knows by the kindling
beauty that glows in his guardian's eyes that
they are nearer to the presence of God and are
sweeping Heaven in a wider arc.</p>

<p>The spirits in the higher heavens see God
with clearer vision, and therefore love Him with
more burning love, and rejoice with a fuller joy
in His presence than those in the lower spheres.
Yet these too rest in perfect peace and oneness
with God's will.</p>

<p>In the Heaven of the Moon, for instance,
the lowest of all, Dante meets Piccarda. She
was the sister of Forese, whom we saw in the
highest circle but one of Purgatory, raised so
far by his widowed Nella's prayers. When
Dante recognises her amongst her companions,
in her transfigured beauty, he says, '"But tell
me, ye whose blessedness is here, do ye desire
a more lofty place, to see more and to be more
loved by God?" She with those other shades
first gently smiled, then answered me so joyous
that she seemed to glow with love's first flame,
"Brother, the power of love so lulls our will, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
makes us long for nought but what we have,
and feel no other thirst. If we should wish to
be exalted more, our wish would be discordant
with His will who here assigned us; and that
may not be within these spheres, as thou thyself
mayst see, knowing that here we needs must
dwell in love, and thinking what love is. Nay,
'tis inherent in this blessedness to hold ourselves
within the will Divine, whereby our wills are
one. That we should be thus rank by rank
throughout this realm ordained, rejoices all the
realm e'en as its King, who draws our wills in
His. And His decree is our peace. It is that
sea to which all things are moved which it
creates and all that nature forges." Then was
it clear to me how every where in Heaven is
Paradise, e'en though the grace distil not in one
mode from that Chief Good.'<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>So again in the second heaven, the Heaven
of Mercury, the soul of Justinian tells the poet
how that sphere is assigned to them whose
lofty aims on earth were in some measure fed
by love of fame and glory rather than inspired
by the true love of God. Hence they are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
this lower sphere. Yet part of their very joy
consists in measuring the exact accord between
the merits and the blessedness of the beatified.
'As diverse voices make sweet melody,' he continues,
'so do the diverse ranks of our life render
sweet harmony amidst these spheres.'<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, one of the marvels of this marvellous
poem is the extreme variety of character and
even of incident which we find in Heaven as
well as in Hell and Purgatory. In each of the
three poems there is one key-note to which we
are ever brought back, but in each there is
infinite variety and delicacy of individual delineation
too. The saints are no more uniform
and characterless in their blessedness than are
the unrepentant sinners in their tortures or the
repentant in their contented pain.</p>

<p>Nor must we suppose that the Paradise
is an unbroken succession of descriptions of
heavenly bliss. Here too, as in Hell and
Purgatory, the things of earth are from time to
time discussed by Dante and the spirits that he
meets. Here too the glow of a lofty indignation
flushes the very spheres of Heaven. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Peter cries against Pope Boniface VIII: 'He
who usurps upon the earth my place, <i>my place</i>,
<span class="smcap">MY PLACE</span>, which in the presence of the Son
of God is vacant now, has made the city of
my sepulture a sink of blood and filth, at which
the rebel Satan, who erst fell from Heaven,
rejoices down in Hell.' And at this the whole
Heaven glows with red, and Beatrice's cheek
flushes as at a tale of shame.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Dante is still the same. The sluggish self-indulgence
of the monks, the reckless and selfish
ambition of the factious nobles and rulers, the
venal infamy of the Court of Rome, cannot be
banished from his mind even by the beatific
visions of Heaven. Nay, the very contrast
gives a depth of indignant sadness to the
denunciations of the Paradise which makes
them almost more terrible than those of Hell
itself.</p>

<p>Interwoven too with the descriptions of the
bliss of Heaven, is the discussion of so wide a
range of moral and theological topics that the
Paradise has been described as having 'summed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
up, as it were, and embodied for perpetuity ...
the quintessence, the living substance, the ultimate
conclusions of the scholastic theology;'<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
and it may well be true that to master the last
cantica of the 'Divine Comedy' is to pierce more
deeply into the heart of mediæval religion and
theology than any of the schoolmen and doctors
of the Church can take us. At the touch of
Dante's staff, the flintiest rock of metaphysical
dogma yields the water of life, and in his mouth
the subtlest discussion of casuistry becomes a
lamp to our feet.</p>

<p>And beyond all this, such is the marvellous
concentration of Dante's poetry, there is room
in the Paradise for long digressions, biographical,
antiquarian, and personal; whilst all
these parts, apparently so heterogeneous, are
welded into perfect symmetry in this one
poem.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Amongst the most important of the episodes
is the account of ancient Florence given to
Dante by his ancestor Cacciaguida, who also
predicts the poet's exile and wanderings, and in
a strain of lofty enthusiasm urges him to pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
out all the heart of his vision and brave the
hatred and the persecution that it will surely
bring upon him.</p>

<p>This Cacciaguida was a Crusader who fell
in the Holy Land, and Dante meets him in the
burning planet of Mars, amongst the mighty
warriors of the Lord whose souls blaze there
in a ruddy glow of glory. There is Joshua,
there Judas Maccabæus, and Charlemagne and
Orlando and Godfrey and many more.</p>

<p>A red cross glows athwart the planet's orb,
and from it beams in mystic guise the Christ;
but how, the poet cannot say, for words and
images are wanting to portray it. Yet he who
takes his cross and follows Christ, will one day
forgive the tongue that failed to tell what he
shall see when to him also Christ shall flash
through that glowing dawn of light.</p>

<p>Here the souls, like rubies that glow redder
from the red-glowing cross as stars shine forth
out of the Milky Way, pass and repass from
horn to horn, from base to summit, and burst
into a brighter radiance as they join and cross,
while strains of lofty and victorious praise, unknown
to mortal ears, gather upon the cross as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
though it were a harp of many strings, touched
by the hand of God, and take captive the entranced,
adoring soul.</p>

<p>There Cacciaguida hailed his descendant
Dante, and long they conversed of the past, the
present, and the future. Alas for our poor
pride of birth! What wonder if men glory in it
here? For even there in Heaven, where no base
appetite distorts the will and judgment, even
there did Dante glow with pride to call this
man his ancestor.</p>

<p>At last their converse ended; Cacciaguida's
soul again was sweeping the unseen strings of
that heavenly harp, and Dante turned again to
look for guidance from his guardian. Beatrice's
eyes were fixed above; and quick as the blush
passes from a fair cheek, so quick the ruddy
glow of Mars was gone, and the white light
of Jupiter shone clear and calm in the sixth
heaven&mdash;the Heaven of the Just.</p>

<p>What a storm of passions and emotions
swept through Dante's soul when he learnt
where he was! 'O chivalry of Heaven!' he
exclaimed in agony, 'pray for those who are
led all astray on earth by foul example.' When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
would the Righteous One again be wroth, and
purge His temple of the traffickers&mdash;His temple
walled by miracles and martyrdoms? How
long should the Pope be suffered to degrade his
holy office by making the penalties of Church
discipline the tools of selfish politics&mdash;how long
should his devotion to St. John the Baptist,
whose head was stamped upon the coins of
Florence, make him neglect the fisherman and
Paul?</p>

<p>Such were the first thoughts that rose in
Dante's mind in the Heaven of the Just; but
they soon gave way to others. Here surely,
here if anywhere, God's justice must be manifest.
Reflected in all Heaven, here must it shine without
a veil. The spirits of the just could surely
solve his torturing doubt. How long had his
soul hungered and found no food on earth, and
now how eagerly did he await the answer to his
doubt! They knew his doubt, he need not tell it
them; oh, let them solve it!</p>

<p>Yes, they knew what he would say: 'A
man is born upon the bank of Indus, and there
there is none to speak of Christ, or read or
write of him. All this man's desires and acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
are good, and without sin, as far as human eye
can see, in deed or word. He dies unbaptised,
without the faith. Where is that justice which
condemns him? Where is his fault in not believing?'
Yes, they knew his doubt, but could
not solve it. Their answer is essentially the
same as Paul's: 'Nay, but, O man, who art
thou that repliest against God?'</p>

<p>The Word of God, say the spirits of the just,
could not be so expressed in all the universe
but what it still remained in infinite excess.
Nay, Lucifer, the highest of created beings, could
not at once see all the light of God, and fell
through his impatience. How then could a
poor mortal hope to scan the ways of God?
His ken was lost in His deep justice as the eye
is lost in the ocean. We can see the shallow
bottom of the shore, but we cannot see the
bottom of the deep, which none the less is
there. So God's unfathomable justice is too
deep, too just, for us to comprehend. The
Primal Will, all goodness in itself, moves not
aside from justice and from good. Never indeed
did man ascend to heaven who believed
not in Christ, yet are there many who cry, Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Lord, and in the day of judgment shall be far
more remote from Christ than many a one that
knew him not.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>With this answer Dante must be content.
He must return from Heaven with this thirst
unslaked, this long hunger still unsatisfied. Ay,
and with this answer must we too rest content.
And yet not with this answer, for we do not ask
this question. That awful load of doubt under
which Dante bent is lifted from our souls, and
for us there is no eternal Hell, there are no
virtuous but rejected Heathen. Yet to us too
the ocean of God's justice is too deep to pierce.
And when we ask why every blessing, every
chance of good, is taken from one child, while
another is bathed from infancy in the light of
love, and is taught sooner than it can walk to
choose the good and to reject the evil, what
answer can we have but Dante's? Rest in
faith. You know God's justice, for you feel it
with you in your heart when you are fighting
for the cause of justice; you know God's justice,
for you feel it in your heart like an avenging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
angel when you sin; you know God's justice&mdash;but
you do not know it all.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There in the Heaven of the Just was David;
now he knew how precious were his songs, since
his reward was such. There too was Trajan,
who by experience of the bliss of Heaven and
pain of Hell knew how dear the cost of not
obeying Christ. There were Constantine, and
William of Sicily, and Ripheus, that just man of
Troy. 'What things are these?' was the cry
that dropped by its own weight from Dante's
lips. The heathens Trajan and Ripheus here!
No, not heathens. Ripheus had so given himself
to justice when on earth, that God in His
grace revealed to him the coming Christ, and
he believed. Faith, Hope, and Charity were his
baptism more than a thousand years ere baptism
was known. And for Trajan, Gregory
had wrestled in prayer for him, had taken the
Kingdom of Heaven by storm with his warm
love and living hope; and since no man repents
in Hell, God at the prayer of Gregory
had recalled the imperial soul back for a moment
to its mouldering clay. There it believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
in Christ, and once more dying, entered on
his joy.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Thus did Dante wrestle with his faith, and
in the passion of his love of virtue and thirst for
justice seek to escape the problem which he
could not solve.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But we must hasten to the close. Dante and
Beatrice have passed through all the heavens.
The poet's sight is gradually strengthened and
prepared for the supreme vision. He has already
seen a kind of symbol of the Uncreated, surrounded
by the angelic ministers. It was in
the ninth heaven, the Heaven of the Primum
Mobile, that he saw a single point of intensest
light surrounded by iris rings, upon which point,
said Beatrice, all Heaven and all nature hung.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>But now they have passed beyond all nine
revolving heavens into the region of 'pure light,
light intellectual full of love, love of the truth
all full of joy, joy that transcends all sweetness.'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
And here the poet sees that for which all else had
been mere preparation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>But I will not strive to reproduce his imagery,
with the mighty river of light inexhaustible, with
the mystic flowers of heavenly perfume, with the
sparks like rubies set in gold ever passing between
the flowers and the river. Of this river
Dante drank, and then the true forms of what
had hitherto been shadowed forth in emblems
only, rose before his eyes. Rank upon rank the
petals of the mystic rose of Paradise stretched
far away around and above him. There were
the blessed souls of the holy ones, bathed in the
light of God that streamed upon them from
above, while the angels ever passed between it
and them ministering peace and love.</p>

<p>There high up, far, far beyond the reach of
mortal eye, had it been on earth, sat Beatrice,
who had left the poet's side. But in Heaven,
with no destroying medium to intervene, distance
is no let to perfect sight. He spoke to
her. He poured out his gratitude to her, for it
was she who had made him a free man from a
slave, she who had made him sane, she who had
left her footprints in Hell for him, when she
went to summon Virgil to his aid. Oh, that his
life hereafter might be worthy of the grace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
power that had so worked for him! Then
from her distant place in Heaven, Beatrice
looked at him and smiled, then turned her eyes
upon the Uncreated Light.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>St. Bernard was at Dante's side, and prayed
that the seer's vision might be strengthened to
look on God. Then Dante turned his eyes to
the light above. The unutterable glory of that
light dazzled not his intent, love-guided gaze.
Nay, rather did it draw it to itself and every
moment strengthen it with keener sight and
feed it with intenser love.</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper into that Divine Light
the seer saw. Had he turned his eyes aside,
then indeed he knew the piercing glory would
have blinded them; but that could never be,
for he who gazes on that light feels all desire
centred there&mdash;in it are all things else. So for
a time with kindling gaze the poet looked
into the light of God, unchanging, yet to the
strengthening sight revealing ever more. Mysteries
that no human tongue can tell, no human
mind conceive, were flashed upon him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
supreme moment, and then all was over&mdash;'The
power of the lofty vision failed.'</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Dante does not tell us where he found himself
when the vision broke. He only tells us
this: that as a wheel moves equally in all its
parts, so his desire and will were, without strain
or jar, revolved henceforth by that same Love
that moves the sun and all the other stars.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>This was the end of all that Dante had
thought and felt and lived through&mdash;a will that
rolled in perfect oneness with the will of God.
This was the end to which he would bring his
readers, this was the purpose of his sacred poem,
this was the meaning of his life.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>Dante's poem&mdash;the true reflection of his mind&mdash;is a
compact and rounded <i>whole</i> in which all the parts
are mutually interdependent. Its digressions are never
excrescences, its episodes are never detached from its
main purpose, its form is never arbitrary and accidental,
but is always the systematic and deliberate expression
of its substance. Moreover it is profoundly
mediæval and Catholic in conception and spirit. The
scholastic theology and science of the Middle Ages
and the spiritual institutions of the Catholic Church
were no trammels to Dante's thought and aspiration.
Under them and amidst them he moved with a
perfect sense of freedom, in them he found the
embodiment of his loftiest conceptions. Against
their abuses his impetuous spirit poured out its lava-stream
of burning indignation, but his very passion
against those who laid impure hands upon the sacred
things of God is the measure of his reverence for
their sanctity.</p>

<p>If the Catholic poet of the fourteenth century
speaks with a voice that can reach the ears and stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the hearts of the Protestant and heretic of the nineteenth,
it is not so much because he rose above the
special forms and conditions of the faith of his own
age as because he went below them and touched the
eternal rock upon which they rested. Not by neglecting
or making light of the dogmas and institutions
of his day, but by piercing to their very heart and
revealing their deepest foundations, did he become
a poet for all time.</p>

<p>The distinction, then, which we are about to draw
between the permanent realities of Dante's religion and
the passing forms, the temporary conditions of belief,
under which it was manifested, is a distinction which
did not exist for him. His faith was a garment woven
without seam, or, to use his own metaphor, a coin so
true in weight and metal, so bright and round, that
there was no 'perhaps' to him in its impression.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>This unwavering certainty alike in principle and
in detail, this unfaltering loyalty to the beliefs of his
day alike in form and substance, is one of the secrets
of Dante's strength.</p>

<p>But, again, such compactness and cohesion of
belief could not have been attained except by the
strict subordination of every article of concrete faith
to the great central conceptions of religion, rising out
of the very nature and constitution of the devout
human soul. And therefore, paradox as it may seem,
the very intensity with which Dante embraced beliefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
that we have definitely and utterly rejected, is the
pledge that we shall find in his teaching the essence
of our own religion; and we may turn to the Comedy
with the certainty that we shall not only discover here
and there passages which will wake an echo in our
bosoms, but shall also find at the very heart of it some
guiding thought that will be to us as it was to him
absolutely true.</p>

<p>Now Dante himself, as we have seen, tells us what
is the subject of his Comedy. Literally it is 'The
state of souls after death,' and allegorically 'Man, as
rendering himself liable to rewarding or punishing
justice, by good or ill desert in the exercise of his
free will.' The ideal requirements of Divine Justice,
then, form the central subject of this poem, the one
theme to which, amidst infinite diversity of application,
the poet remains ever true; and these requirements
he works out in detail and enforces with all the
might, the penetration, the sweetness of his song,
under the conditions of mediæval belief as to the
future life.</p>

<p>But these conditions of belief are utterly foreign
to our own conceptions. I say nothing of the rejection
of the virtuous heathen, because Dante himself
could really find no room for it in his own system of
conceptions. It lay in his mind as a belief accepted
from tradition, but never really assimilated by faith.
Apart from this, however, we find ourselves severed
from Dante by his fundamental dogma that the hour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
death ends all possibility of repentance or amendment.
With him there is no repentance in Hell, no
progress in Heaven; and it is therefore only in Purgatory
that we find anything at all fundamentally
analogous to the modern conception of a progressive
approximation to ideal perfection and oneness with
God throughout the cycles of a future life. And even
here the transition of Purgatory is but temporal, nor
is there any fundamental or progressive change of
heart in its circles, for unless the heart be changed
before death it cannot change at all.</p>

<p>In its literal acceptation, then, dealing with 'the
state of souls after death,' the 'Divine Comedy' has
little to teach us, except indirectly.</p>

<p>But allegorically it deals with 'man,' first as impenitently
sinful; second, as penitent; last, as purified
and holy. It shows us the requirements of Divine
Justice with regard to these three states; and whether
we regard them as permanent or transitory, as severed
by sharp lines one from the other or as melting imperceptibly
into each other, as existing on earth or
beyond the grave, in any case Dante teaches us what
sentence justice must pronounce on impenitence, on
penitence, and on sanctity. Nay, independently of
any belief in future retribution at all, independently of
any belief in what our actions will receive, Dante
burns or flashes into our souls the indelible conviction
of what they deserve.</p>

<p>Now to Dante's mind, as to most others, the conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of <i>justice</i> and <i>desert</i> implied the conception
of <i>free will</i>. And accordingly we find the reality
of the choice exercised by man, and attended by such
eternal issues, maintained with intense conviction
throughout the poem. The free will is the supreme
gift of God, and that by which the creature most
closely partakes of the nature of the Creator. The
free gift of God's love must be seized by an act of
man's free will, in opposition to the temptations and
difficulties that interpose themselves. There is justice
as well as love in Heaven; justice as well as mercy in
Purgatory. The award of God rests upon the free
choice of man, and registers his merit or demerit. It
is true, and Dante fully recognises it, that one man has
a harder task than another. The original constitution
and the special circumstances of one man make the
struggle far harder for him than for another; but God
never suffers the hostile influence of the stars to be so
strong that the human will may not resist it. Diversity
of character and constitution is the necessary
condition of social life, and we can see why God did
not make us all alike; but when we seek to pierce yet
deeper into the mystery of His government, and ask
why this man is selected for this task, why another is
burdened with this toil, why one finds the path of
virtue plain for his feet to tread, while one finds it
beset with obstacles before which his heart stands
still&mdash;when we ask these questions we trench close
upon one of those doubts which Dante brought back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
unsolved from Heaven. Not the seraph whose sight
pierces deepest into the light of God could have told
him this, so utterly is it veiled from all created sight.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>But amidst all these perplexities one supreme fact
stands out to Dante's mind: that, placed as we are
on earth amidst the mysterious possibilities of good
and evil, we are endowed with a genuine power of
self-directed choice between them. The fullness of
God's grace is freely offered to us all, the life eternal
of obedience, of self-surrender, of love, tending ever to
the fuller and yet fuller harmony of united will and
purpose, of mutually blessed and blessing offices of
affection, of growing joy in all the supporting and
surrounding creation, of growing repose in the might
and love of God.</p>

<p>But if we shut our eyes against the light of God's
countenance and turn our backs upon His love, if we
rebel against the limitations of mutual self-sacrifice to
one another and common obedience to God, then an
alternative is also offered us in the fierce and weltering
chaos of wild passions and disordered desires,
recognising no law and evoking no harmony, striking
at the root of all common purpose and cut off from
all helpful love.</p>

<p>Our inmost hearts recognise the reality of this
choice, and the justice and necessity of the award
that gives us what we have chosen. That the hard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
bitter, self-seeking, impure, mutinous, and treacherous
heart should drive away love and peace and joy is the
natural, the necessary result of the inmost nature and
constitution of things, and our hearts accept it. That
self-discipline, gentleness, self-surrender, devotion,
generosity, self-denying love, should gather round
them light and sweetness, should infuse a fullness of
joy into every personal and domestic relation, should
give a glory to every material surrounding, and should
gain an ever closer access to God, is no artificial
arrangement which might with propriety be reversed,
it is a part of the eternal and necessary constitution
of the universe, and we feel that it ought so to be.</p>

<p>There is no joy or blessedness without harmony,
there is no harmony without the concurrence of
independent forces, there is no such concurrence
without self-discipline and self-surrender.</p>

<p>But these natural consequences of our moral
action are here on earth constantly interfered with
and qualified, constantly baulked of their full and
legitimate effect. Here we do not get our deserts.
The actions of others affect us almost as much as
our own, and artificially interpose themselves to
screen us from the results of what we are and do ourselves.
Hence we constantly fail to perceive the true
nature of our choice. Its consequences fall on others;
we partially at least evade the Divine Justice, and forget
or know not what we are doing, and what are the
demands of justice with regard to us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Dante, in his three poems, with an incisive
keenness of vision and a relentless firmness of touch,
that stand alone, strips our life and our principles of
action of all these distracting and confusing surroundings,
isolates them from all qualifying and artificial
palliatives, and shows us what our choice is and where
it leads to.</p>

<p>In Hell we see the natural and righteous results
of sin, recognise the direct consequences, the fitting
surroundings of a sinful life, and understand what the
sinful choice in its inmost nature is. As surely as
our consciences accuse us of the sins that are here
punished, so surely do we feel with a start of self-accusing
horror, 'This is what I am trying to make
the world. This is where we should be lodged if I
received what I have given. This is what justice
demands that I should have. This is what I deserve.
It is what I have chosen.'</p>

<p>The tortures of Hell are not artificial inflictions,
they are simply the reflection and application of the
sinner's own ways and principles. He has made his
choice, and he is given that which he has chosen.
He has found at last a world in which his principles
of action are not checked and qualified at every turn
by those of others, in which he is not screened from
any of the consequences of his deeds, in which his
own life and action has consolidated, so to speak,
about him, and has made his surroundings correspond
with his heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Hell, Dante shows us the nature and the
deserts of impenitent sin; and though we may well
shrink from the ghastly conception of an eternal state
of impenitence and hatred, yet surely there is nothing
from which we ought to shrink in the conception of
impenitent sin as long as it lasts, whether in us or in
others, concentrating its results upon itself, making its
own place and therefore receiving its deserts.</p>

<p>When we turn from Hell to Purgatory, we turn
from unrepentant and therefore constantly cherished,
renewed, and reiterated sin, to repentant sin, already
banished from the heart. What does justice demand
with regard to such sin? Will it have it washed out?
Will it, in virtue of the sinner's penitence, interpose between
him and the wretched results and consequences
of his deeds? Who that has ever sinned and repented
will accept for a moment such a thought? The repentant
sinner does not <i>wish</i> to escape the consequences
and results of his sin. His evil deeds or passions
must bring and ought to bring a long trail of wretched
suffering for himself. This suffering is not corrective,
it is expiatory. His heart is already corrected, it is
already turned in shame and penitence to God; but if
he had no punishment, if his evil deed brought no
suffering upon himself, he would feel that the Divine
Justice had been outraged. He shrinks from the
thought with a hurt sense of moral unfitness. He
wishes to suffer, he would not escape into the peace of
Heaven if he might.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Never did Dante pierce more deeply into the truth
of things, never did he bring home the <i>justice</i> of
punishment more closely to the heart, than when he
told how the souls in Purgatory do not wish to rise
to Heaven till they have worked out the consequences
of their sins. The sin long since repented and renounced
still haunts us with its shame and its remorse,
still holds us from the fullness of the joy of God's love,
still smites us with a keener pain the closer we press
into the forgiving Father's presence; and we would
have it so. The deepest longing of our heart, which
is now set right, is for full, untroubled communion
with God, yet it is just when nearest to Him that we
feel the wretched penalty of our sin most keenly and
that we least desire to escape it.</p>

<p>But if the sinful disposition be gone, then the
source of our suffering is dried up with it, and the
sense of oneness with God, of harmony and trust,
gradually overpowers the self-reproach, until from the
state of penitence and suffering the soul rises to holiness
and peace.</p>

<p>It is in giving us glimpses of this final state that
Dante wields his most transforming power over our
lives. He shows us what God offers us, what it is
that we have hitherto refused, what it is that we may
still aspire to, that here or hereafter we may hope
to reach. Sin-stained and sorrow-laden as we are,
it is only on wings as strong as his that we can be
raised even for a moment into that Divine blessedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
in which sin has been so purged by suffering, so dried
up by the sinner's love of God, so blotted out by God's
love of him, that it has vanished as a dream, and the
soul can say, 'Here we repent not.'<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> How mighty the
spirit that can raise us even for a moment from the
desolate weariness of Hell, and the long suffering of
Purgatory, to the joy and peace of Heaven!</p>

<p>And here too there is justice. Here too the deserts
of the soul are the gauge of its condition. For, as we
have seen, in the very blessedness of Heaven there
are grades, and the soul which has once been stained
with sin or tainted with selfish and worldly passion,
can never be as though it had been always pure. Yet
the torturing sense of unworthiness is gone, the
unrest of a past that thwarts the present is no more;
the souls have cast off the burden of their sin, and
are at perfect peace with God and with themselves.</p>

<p>Sin, repentance, holiness, confronted with the
Eternal Justice&mdash;what they are and what they
deserve&mdash;such is the subject of Dante Alighieri's
Comedy.</p>

<p>Have five and a half centuries of progress outgrown
the poem, or are Dante's still the mightiest and
most living words in which man has ever painted in
detail the true deserts of sin, of penitence, of sanctity?
The growing mind of man has burst the shell of
Dante's mediæval creed. Is his portrayal of the true
conditions of blessedness as antiquated as his philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
his religion as strange to modern thought as his
theology? Or has he still a power, wielded by no
other poet, of taking us into the very presence of God
and tuning our hearts to the harmonies of Heaven?
Those who have been with him on his mystic journey,
and have heard and seen, can answer these questions
with a declaration as clear and ringing as the poet's
own confession of faith in the courts of Heaven. If
those who have but caught some feeble echoes of his
song can partly guess what the true answer is, then
those echoes have not been waked in vain.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
